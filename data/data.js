Jilson, deputy range forest officer, Kadamanpara forest station, has been transferred from Thenmala division to Punalur division following the incident. According to Sandeep Mathew, a 39-year-old resident, he was tied up and brutally beaten by the officer and some other staff on Friday evening. Reportedly, Sandeep, who was coming back from his farm in an auto, was stopped by the officials. This led to an argument following which he was dragged to the station. He sustained fracture on his nasal bone and he was shifted to Punlaur taluk hospital by Thenmala police.\n\nThe incident generated much public outrage after the pictures and videos of a bleeding Sandeep started circulating on social media. While political parties and residents took out marches to the Kadamanpara station on Saturday, protests were organised at various parts of the State by the Kerala Independent Farmers Association.\n\nMeanwhile, Forest officials said Sandeep was not willing to cooperate with them when they tried to check his auto and the officials were attacked first.",

          "body": "House GOP pushes Hunter Biden probe despite thin majority\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Even with their threadbare House majority, Republicans doubled down this week on using their new power next year to investigate the Biden administration and, in particular, the president's son.\n\nBut the midterm results have emboldened a White House that has long prepared for this moment. Republicans secured much smaller margins than anticipated, and aides to President Joe Biden and other Democrats believe voters punished the GOP for its reliance on conspiracy theories and Donald Trump-fueled lies over the 2020 election.\n\nThey see it as validation for the administration's playbook for the midterms and going forward to focus on legislative achievements and continue them, in contrast to Trump-aligned candidates whose complaints about the president's son played to their most loyal supporters and were too far in the weeds for the average American. The Democrats retained control of the Senate and the GOP's margin in the House is expected to the slimmest majority in two decades.\n\nPeople are also reading...

They were coming to the polls because they were upset about inflation. They're upset about gas prices. They're upset about what's going on with the war in Ukraine.\"\n\nBut House Republicans used their first news conference after clinching the majority to discuss presidential son Hunter Biden and the Justice Department, renewing long-held grievances about what they claim is a politicized law enforcement agency and a bombshell corruption case overlooked by Democrats and the media.\n\n'We survived': Kherson comes alive after Russian withdrawal\n\nKHERSON, Ukraine (AP) -- A week since the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson was liberated, residents can't escape reminders of the terrifying eight months they spent under Russian occupation: missing people, mines everywhere, closed shops and restaurants, a scarcity of electricity and water -- and explosions day and night as Russian and Ukrainian forces battle just across the Dnieper River.\n\nDespite these hardships, Kherson residents are expressing a mix of relief, optimism, and even joy -- not least because of their regained freedom to express themselves at all.\n\n\"Even breathing became easier. Everything is different now,\" said Olena Smoliana, a pharmacist whose eyes shone with happiness as she recalled the day Ukrainian soldiers entered the city.\n\nKherson's population has dwindled to around 80,000 from its prewar level near 300,000, but the city is slowly coming alive.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy triumphantly walked the streets on Monday, hailing Russia's withdrawal -- a humiliating defeat for Russian President Vladimir Putin -- as the \"beginning of the end of the war.\"\n\nPeople are no longer afraid to leave home, or worried that contact with Russian soldiers might lead to a prison or torture cell. They are gathering in city squares -- adorned with blue-and-yellow ribbons on their bags and jackets -- to recharge phones, collect water, or talk with neighbors and relatives.\n\nIn Pelosi, women admire a leader with calm, cool confidence\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) -- As they watched House Speaker Nancy Pelosi step forward to wrangle an unruly Congress over the years or stare down a bombastic president, many women across the country saw a version of the calm, confident leader they hoped to be themselves.\n\nPelosi, in rooms full of powerful men, was tenacious, tactical, tough. All while being a devoted mother and grandmother at home. And rarely finding the need to raise her voice.\n\n\"The image of her coming out in the red coat was just always amusing to me because it just kind of personified how badass she is,\" said Gina Lind, 61, of Phoenix, a marketing director for an airline. \"It completely represented a woman in quiet control.\"\n\nAfter her announcement this week that she would step down from Democratic leadership after two decades, many people reposted that meme of Pelosi confidently striding out of the Trump White House in sunglasses and a long red coat following a tense meeting. The moment was a reminder of how Pelosi, the first woman to become House speaker, redefined outdated expectations about the role of women in the highest levels of government.\n\nFans of Pelosi, a California Democrat, have taped the image to their refrigerator, downloaded it as a screensaver or emblazoned it on coffee mugs. They likewise savor the photos of her confronting then-President Donald Trump in the White House Cabinet Room or ripping up his final State of the Union speech.\n\nAsia-Pacific leaders condemn war, renew calls for open trade\n\nBANGKOK (AP) -- Leaders from around the Asia-Pacific called for an end to Russia's war on Ukraine and pledged to steer the region's economies toward sustainable growth as they wrapped up summit meetings Saturday.\n\nHost Thailand garnered a diplomatic coup in managing to bridge divisions among the 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum by saying that most members had condemned the war. Russia is an APEC member, as is China, which generally has refrained from criticizing Moscow.\n\nThe declaration issued by APEC leaders acknowledged differing views on the war and said the forum, which is devoted largely to promoting trade and closer economic ties, was not a venue for resolving such conflicts.\n\nBut it noted that the conflict and other security issues \"can have significant consequences for the global economy.\"\n\nThe leaders' statement said most members had strongly condemned the war in Ukraine, stressing that it is causing immense human suffering and worsening inflation, supply chain troubles, food insecurity and financial risks.\n\nNorth Korea's Kim boasts new ICBM as US flies bombers\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un boasted that a recently tested intercontinental ballistic missile is another \"reliable and maximum-capacity\" weapon to contain U.S. military threats, state media reported Saturday. The United States responded to the North's weapons launch by flying supersonic bombers in a show of force.\n\nThe North's Korean Central News Agency said Kim oversaw the launch of the Hwasong-17 missile, a day after its neighbors said they had detected the launch of an ICBM that showed a potential to reach anywhere in the United States.\n\nKCNA said Kim observed the launch with his wife Ri Sol Ju and their \"beloved daughter\" as well as senior officials. State media photos showed Kim walking hand-in-hand with his daughter, who was clad in a white coat, together watching a huge missile loaded on a launch truck. It's the first time for North Korea to publish the photo of Kim's daughter. Observers say Kim observing a weapons launch with his family suggests that he was confident in its success.\n\nKim, 38, is the third generation of his family to rule North Korea. South Korean media reported he has three children born in 2010, 2013 and 2017, respectively. It wasn't immediately known which child he took to the launch site.\n\nFriday's launch was part of the North's ongoing barrage of missile tests that are seen as an attempt to expand its arsenal and boost its leverage in future diplomacy. Some foreign experts said the Hwasong-17 missile is still under development but is the North's longest-range ballistic weapon designed to carry multiple nuclear warheads to defeat U.S. missile defense systems.\n\nNorth Korea unveils Kim's daughter at missile launch site\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea has unveiled the little-known daughter of its leader Kim Jong Un at a missile launch site, attracting keen attention on a fourth-generation member of the dynastic family that has ruled North Korea for more than seven decades.\n\nThe North's state media said Saturday that Kim had observed the launch of its new type of intercontinental ballistic missile with his wife Ri Sol Ju, their \"beloved daughter\" and other officials the previous day. Kim said the launch of the Hwasong-17 missile -- the North's longest-range, nuclear-capable missile -- proved he has a reliable weapon to contain U.S.-led military threats.\n\nThe main Rodong Sinmun newspaper also released a slew of photos of Kim watching a soaring missile from a distance with his daughter. Other photos showed her with her hair pulled back, wearing a white coat and a pair of red shoes as she walked in hand-in-hand with her father by a huge missile atop a launch truck.\n\nIt's the first time for North Korea's state media to mention the daughter or publicize her photos. KCNA didn't provide further details about her like her name and age.\n\nMuch of Kim's private life is still unknown. But South Korean media reported Kim married Ri, a former singer, in 2009, and that the couple have three children who were born in 2010, 2013 and 2017.\n\nDespair, lack of progress at climate talks, yet hope blooms\n\nSHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP) -- It's a desert, where little grows. It's a climate conference, where water is scarce inside buildings and out, lines are long, tempers are short, meetings go late and above all progress comes in one-drop drips.\n\nYet hope springs forth in the strangest places.\n\nNot in the naïve new face, but in the hearts and minds of veteran activists and officials, who have gone through this frustrating sleep-depriving exercise, not once or twice but numerous times.\n\nAnd it blooms in a odd metal \"tree\" sculpture in a center square here at the United Nations climate summit in Egypt. People write their hopes on green paper leaves.\n\n\"Hope is the only meaning (sic) that makes us ALIVE!\" Mohamed Ageez, an Egyptian youth activist wrote.\n\nUN climate talks drag into extra time with scant progress\n\nSHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP) -- United Nations climate talks ran into extra time on Saturday with little sign of a breakthrough, as negotiations remain hung up on key issues including funds for the loss and damage suffered by poorer vulnerable countries hit by extreme weather.\n\nOfficials from country delegations arrived at the sprawling conference zone, now mostly empty, for another day of negotiations.\n\n\"Negotiations went all through the night,\" said Egyptian diplomat Wael Aboulmagd, who heads the Egyptian delegation. \"We needed to finalize some of the documents.\"\n\nBritain's Alok Sharma, who chaired last year's talks in Glasgow, said his team was going to \"have a \u2060\u2060look and see what the latest text is but the key point is: it needs to be ambitious and it needs to be balanced.\"\n\nIn a setback, top U.S. climate envoy John Kerry tested positive for COVID-19 though he only has mild symptoms and is working by phone with his negotiating team and foreign counterparts, his spokesperson said late Friday.\n\nChina's COVID-19 restrictions hit historic Beijing theater\n\nBEIJING (AP) -- Performances have been suspended at one of Beijing's oldest and most renowned theaters as part of a new wave of shop and restaurant closures in response to a spike in COVID-19 cases in the Chinese capital.\n\nThe Jixiang Theater in the downtown Wangfujing shopping district was originally built in 1906 and recently moved to its present location on the 8th floor of a shopping mall that also houses shops and a fast food restaurant. It is famed for performances of Peking opera and other traditional art forms.\n\nPerformances were due to resume Nov. 27, but such dates for re-opening have frequently been extended.\n\nChina reported 24,263 new cases Saturday, 515 of them in Beijing. The vast majority were asymptomatic.\n\nDespite that, lockdowns and other strict control measures have been put in place around the country, with many Beijing residents sent notices advising them not to leave home unless absolutely necessary.\n\nAccused Albany bishop asks to be removed from priesthood\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) -- The retired bishop of Albany, New York, who has admitted to covering up for predator priests and has himself been accused of sexual abuse, has asked Pope Francis to remove him from the priesthood.\n\nEmeritus Bishop Howard Hubbard, 84, announced the decision in a statement Friday, the day the United Nations designated as the World Day for the Prevention of, and Healing from Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Violence.\n\nHubbard said he wanted to be laicized, or returned to the lay state, because he could no longer function as a priest, given U.S. church policy that bars accused priests from ministry. If accepted, laicization would relieve Hubbard of his celibacy obligations.\n\nAsking the pope for voluntary laicization is unusual, especially for a bishop and particularly for a cleric who denies abuse allegations against him. Usually priests ask to be laicized if evidence of abuse against them is overwhelming or if they want to leave the priesthood to get married. The Vatican can forcibly laicize priests, or defrock them, as a punishment for such crimes as clergy sexual abuse.\n\nHubbard has acknowledged covering up allegations of sexual abuse against children by priests in part to avoid scandal and protect the reputation of the diocese. He did so in a deposition for one of dozens of claims by hundreds of people who have sued the Albany diocese over sexual abuse they say they endured as children, sometimes decades ago.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

GM Perry Minasian challenged himself to be better this offseason, and that's exactly what he's done.\n\nFirst, he shored up the rotation, signing All-Star LHP Tyler Anderson to a three-year deal at $13 million a season. Then, he went out and traded for 31-year-old infielder Gio Urshela from the Twins, a career .275 hitter with 62 home runs and 256 RBIs.\n\nWhere Urshela will play on the field is yet to be determined. He's played 548 of his 582 career games at third base. His next highest position is shortstop, where he's played in 43 games. He's also played five games at second base, and three at first base. But figuring out where he'll play is the easy part -- and Angel fans are thrilled to see Minasian making win-now moves early on in free agency.\n\nEarly on in free agency, Minasian and the Angels are making all the right moves. They've shored up the starting rotation and the infield, leaving the corner outfield spot as the biggest need the team is left to fill. However, this doesn't mean they're done making moves. They still could look to make a big splash at shortstop, and add another arm to the rotation. Minasian has proven he wants to contend. The Angels aren't done making moves.",

The Joint Transportation Committee (JTC) received legislative direction to convene a Vehicle Registration Payment Options Workgroup to analyze payment options for vehicle fees and publish a report.\n\n\"I appreciate the approach we took to analyze this issue,\" said Sen. T'wina Nobles (D-Fircrest), who spearheaded the effort during the 2020 legislative session in response to requests from her community. \"We used surveys and focus groups to center community members and hear from those directly affected.\"\n\nThe JTC contracted with BERK Consulting to study the issue and explore options. The study was guided by an eight-member stakeholder workgroup consisting of representatives from:\n\nThe study addressed the questions: \"Could the State reduce the impact of registration tax and fee payment on households with low incomes by offering a payment plan? If so, how could that payment plan be structured?\"\n\nBERK Consulting found that 77% of survey respondents preferred annual registration payments rather than quarterly. They also identified high financial costs for State Department of Licensing (DOL) to develop and administer a payment plan -- a cost that would require significant investment from the State. Additionally, a quarterly payment system would require a service fee, a key reason respondents preferred an annual payment plan.\n\n\"Community members are still experiencing hardship due to lasting effects from the pandemic, shortages, and overwhelmingly, inflation,\" said Nobles. \"What this means is that we need to continue assessing the most effective strategies to reduce the burden on lower-income families and community members. We'll continue to analyze different strategies with experts and, of course, with community.\"\n\nBERK Consulting advised three recommendations:\n\nThe 2023 legislative session will reconvene in January to consider legislation and draft the state transportation budget for the coming biennium.",

          "title": "Want to stop Trump once and for all? Let him run in 2024",
          "body": "Opinion: This was never going to end with Donald Trump stepping away on his own. Haven't you read stories?\n\nWe're still counting votes from the midterms, but the 2024 election has already begun.\n\nIn a low-energy speech on Tuesday night, Donald Trump announced his anticipated candidacy at Mar-a-Lago. The former president promised to \"make America great and glorious again,\" called \"rotten\" U.S. cities \"cesspools of blood\" and near the close, stated, \"I am a victim. I am a victim.\"\n\nNot exactly \"a shining city on a hill,\" but this is Trump we're talking about.\n\nHe previewed his campaign two weeks ago, firing at potential rivals during a Latrobe, Penn., campaign rally for Senate candidate Mehmet Oz and gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano. (Oz lost by 4.5%; Mastriano lost by 14.4%.)\n\nTrump read 2024 presidential polls just three days before the 2022 election. \"There it is, Trump at 71. Ron DeSanctimonious at 10 percent,\" Trump said. \"Mike Pence at 7; oh, Mike Pence [is] doing better than I thought.\"\n\nSeveral Republicans made fun of Trump's lame nickname for Florida's non-sanctimonious governor, while others were outraged - including those who supported The Donald in the past.\n\nA few days later, Trump took on Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., with an uglier attack.\n\n\"Young Kin (now that's an interesting take. Sounds Chinese, doesn't it?),\" Trump posted on his Truth Social network. Then he blasted Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, R-Va., while taking full credit for the pair's 2021 victories.\n\nNeither DeSantis nor Youngkin responded in kind. What's the point? Like the scorpion told the frog, it is his nature. The ex-president's attacks revealed his own insecurity, more than anything.\n\nThe fear is understandable. DeSantis won reelection by nearly 20% and his state party crushed Democrats up and down the ticket. That's a far sight better than Trump's performance.\n\nKari Lake and Blake Masters lost in Arizona, the Pennsylvania ticket sunk hard, and would-be senators Don Bolduc and Adam Laxalt lost in New Hampshire and Nevada, respectively. Add in Trump's lousy picks for gubernatorial and House races, and you have an unparalleled disaster for the GOP.\n\nActually, not unparalleled if you consider his dismal record in 2018 and 2020. Trump might have eked out an electoral college win against the deeply unpopular Hillary Clinton in 2016, but it's been losses ever since.\n\nMany right-leaning politicos pleaded with the 76-year-old Trump to step aside for fresher leaders. That was never going to happen. And if he doesn't win the GOP nom, he's likely to mount a third-party run, helping Democrats once again.\n\nOf course, he should back off for the good of the party. But he's never cared about the good of the party. For all we know this candidacy is just another way to gather donations or avoid indictment.\n\nIn the long run, it's healthier for the GOP that Trump does run for president - and is soundly defeated in the primaries. If DeSantis, Pence or Youngkin seek the nomination, let them fight for it. The only way the party turns the page is for voters to do the turning.\n\nNo backroom deals between Bushes and McConnells will solve the Trump dilemma. The grassroots made him and the grassroots are the only ones who can retire him to the back nine at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nBesides, Trump stepping away of his own accord was never how this story was going to end. Haven't you read stories?\n\nGoing all the way back to first storytellers, it's not like the Titans stepped aside and gave Zeus the C-suite. The young upstarts had to defeat the old guard, fair and square. If any candidate wants to take control of the fractious GOP, they need to prove their mettle the old-fashioned way: winning elections.\n\nAnd if the Republicans don't unify behind a new leader, they can expect another loss in 2024. Then in 2026.",

          "body": "On Yellowstone, Walker has flirted with death several times, but a near-fatal fight between him and bunkhouse veteran Lloyd was most unexpected. Fans may recall the older cowboy turning and flinging a knife at the guy who just took his girlfriend.\n\nIt happened during Ep. 6 of Season 4, titled \"I Want to Be Him.\" Lloyd (Forrie J. Smith) is already smarting about Laramie (Hassie Harrison) choosing Walker (Ryan Bingham) over him, and then he sees the rest of the bunkhouse boys palling around with his new nemesis. So, he smashes Walker's guitar, and when challenged to fight, he throws a knife into his chest.\n\nSpoiler alert: Walker doesn't die. He's already appeared in Season 5 and -- talking to Taste of Country -- Bingham indicated his character makes it through all filmed episodes. The medical team allows everyone to breathe a sigh of relief when they say the knife just missed Walker's heart. Then they turn to the problem of taking the knife out, but Laramie grows impatient and just rips it out of her boyfriend's chest.\n\nBlood spills out of Walker, but during several takes prior to the one Yellowstone producers chose, it was much messier. Bingham recalls enjoying the special effects. He's relatively new to this world, and these kinds of scenes are his first. It was a learning experience, albeit a messy one.\n\n\"I remember they had a plastic hose that kind of ran up my back and under my shirt so when ... she pulls the knife out, the blood is supposed to squirt out,\" he shares during a just-released episode of the Dutton Rules Podcast.\n\n\"I remember the first couple of takes, they had the pressure turned way up on that line, so when she pulled that knife out, it was like a Tarantino movie. Blood was spraying all over the room and all over everybody,\" he adds with a laugh.\n\nSeason 5 of Yellowstone continues on Sunday (Nov. 20) on the Paramount Network. Through two episodes, fans have seen relatively little of Walker, but that figures to change soon.",

But I think for the past year I kind of thought I'd have a girl.

          "body": "Legal gambling means you may not find yourself in trouble with the law for wagering on the World Cup or any other sporting event. But it also means it may be easier for bettors to slip into dangerous habits.\n\nWhile placing friendly or even serious wagers on sports can be a fun way to get involved in the game, routine gambling can quickly become a problem, even before the person making bets realizes it.\n\n\"[Gambling] is a hidden addiction -- there are not as many outward signs,\" Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, tells CNBC Make It.\n\nAmericans often recognize substance abuse because of the physical, visible effects substances can have on someone's body, Whyte says. But, \"there's no substance in gambling, so people misunderstand it as a moral or an issue of weak will.\"\n\nIt's difficult to track the number of Americans dealing with gambling problems or clinically defined gambling addictions due to a lack of reporting, stigma and gaps in education around problematic behaviors. But Whyte says the risk factors that can lead more people to having issues are on the rise.\n\nRisk factors can include lying to your loved ones about gambling or having difficulty cutting back on betting, which NCPG has been able to track through surveys.\n\nThese indicators have \"risen by about 30% between 2018 and 2021,\" says Whyte. \"We've also seen significant increases in calls, texts and chats to our national helpline -- roughly a 45% increase in calls between 2021 and 2022.\"\n\nWhile those reports are not a direct correlation to a rise in problem gambling or addictions, they still signal that an increase in gambling venues can drive an uptick in concerning habits, Whyte says.",

          "body": "Tennessee's Supreme Court ruled against a state law mandating life sentences for juvenile homicide offenders on Friday, stating it was \"cruel and unusual punishment,\" and a violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nIn the 21-page opinion, the justices noted Tennessee was the only state in the country requiring the offenders to serve more than 50 years in prison before being considered for parole. Juvenile homicide offenders are eligible for release before serving 35 years in most other U.S. states.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Sharon Lee said Tennessee is \"out of step\" with the rest of the country when it comes to the severity of sentences handed to the offenders in question.\n\n\"Automatically imposing a fifty-one-year-minimum life sentence on a juvenile offender without regard to the juvenile's age and attendant circumstances can, for some juveniles, offend contemporary standards of decency,\" Lee wrote in the 3-2 majority opinion, according to the Associated Press.\n\nMONTANA SUPREME COURT DECLINES TO BLOCK LAW BANNING VACCINE MANDATES IN MOST WORKPLACES\n\nIn a dissenting opinion, Justices Jeffrey Bivins and Roger Page argued state courts should not make \"broad moral and social policy judgments\" and sentencing decisions should be left to the legislative branch.\n\nAccording to the AP, Tennessee has been criticized for years for its \"unusually harsh prison terms for juveniles.\" More than 100 people have been sentenced to serve 60 years in jail after convictions when they were children.\n\nNational attention was placed on Tennessee in 2006 when Cyntoia Brown-Long, who was a 16-year-old sex trafficking victim at the time, was convicted of murdering a 42-year-old real estate agent in Nashville.\n\nIn 2019, Republican Gov. Bill Haslam granted Brown-Long clemency, stating that having to wait 51 years in prison for a parole hearing was \"too harsh.\"\n\nTENNESSEE TINDER DATE ALLEGEDLY CARJACKS WOMAN, OFFERS TO SELL CAR BACK TO HER FOR $500\n\nAfter Friday's ruling, judges will now be able to adjust sentences for juveniles convicted of first-degree murder. The court also encouraged state lawmakers to consider legislation that would allow for more \"discretionary, individualized sentencing,\" the AP reported.\n\nRepublicans currently control both chambers in the state legislature and have been pushing for stricter sentencing requirements.\n\nThe court's decision comes from a 2015 case where Tyshon Booker, 16, was convicted as an adult for the first-degree murder of G'Metrik Caldwell.\n\nUnder the new ruling, Booker's 60-year sentence will now be eligible for parole after 25 to 36 years served. His age and other circumstances will also be allowed to be considered in any future decisions made.\n\nThe new ruling does not mean any sentences will be overturned.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

          "title": "Two women with a silent mountain between them",
          "body": "BEIRUT -- \"In cinema, they say, when you see a mother, you think of Mother Nature,\" says Lebanese filmmaker Bassem Breche. \"A woman is a mother and a mother is Mother Nature. Basically, I wanted this film to break that metaphorical chain.\"\n\nBreche, at times, looks a bit pixelated as he discusses his new film, Riverbed. The jury is out on whether to blame Lebanon's wobbly internet for disrupting this Zoom meeting, or the crap wifi at Breche's Cairo hotel.\n\nThe writer-director's feature film debut will be held at the Cairo International Film Festival on Saturday. Riverbed is competing in Horizons of Arab Cinema, the CIFF section devoted to Arabic-language cinema, alongside seven other titles -- including \"Mother Valley,\" by Breche's countryman Carlos Chahine.\n\nSet in a remote village in Chouf, Mount Lebanon, Riverbed tells the story of Salma (Carol Abboud), a self-reliant woman nearing middle age, whose routine is disrupted when her past comes to visit.\n\nSalma works from home, operating the switchboard of the village's antiquated telephone network. During working hours she's visited by two ladies of a certain age, who slurp maté -- the tea popular in regions that have known migration to Latin America -- and swap gossip about sinful neighbors who have breached village propriety.\n\nSalma seems indifferent to such recreational hearsay. In her off hours, she manages a furtive romance that would itself be worthy of a few pots of maté, were it to be discovered.\n\nCarole Abboud and Rabih El Zahr in a still from Bassem Breche's 'Riverbed.' (Courtesy of The Attic Productions)\n\nOne evening, a young woman turns up at Salma's house and, finding no one at home, lets herself in. After nosing around a bit, she falls asleep. Sometime later she re-opens her eyes to a blur that resolves into the handgun Salma is pointing at her face.\n\nSalma recognizes the stranger in her bed as her daughter, Thuraya (Omaya Malaeb, formerly Mashrou' Layla's keyboardist). Lowering her pistol, Abboud clinches the scene's dark comedy.\n\n\"You never know these days,\" the mother mutters. \"You should shut the door behind you.\"\n\nAmidst the shared silences of their taciturn relationship, Salma learns that Thuraya may need her help.\n\nPlotting a film\n\nBreche says the makings of this story have been with him for a while.\n\n\"Basically, I'm interested in telling stories of families,\" he says. \"I was born in the late 70s and grew up in a remote village in Mount Lebanon. There were absolutely no men around. They were either fighting or working or had left the village to the Khalij or Africa or the US or wherever.\"\n\nHis childhood experience was one of a village populated by women, babies and old people.\n\n\"In the village, you're not exposed to anything,\" Breche recalls. \"There was no cinema, no theatre, nothing. You just have to deal with what's in front of you. I spent a lot of time walking around with my mother in the mornings, spending time with other women. I heard lots of stories of women.\n\n\"When I started working on the script, five or six years back, I was re-visiting that time in my life. That's when I decided to make a film about a woman's story, the story of a mother-daughter relationship.\"\n\nCarole Abboud and Omaya Malaeb in a still from Bassem Breche's 'Riverbed.' (Courtesy of The Attic Productions)\n\nThe writer-director started developing the script for Riverbed in 2014. Breche has scripted several series over the years -- not least Shankaboot, 2009-2011, which won an International Digital Emmy Award in 2011.\n\nFor his freshman feature, he shares writing credits with Ghassan Salhab, a seasoned arthouse filmmaker with six features and numerous film essays to his credit. Breche says he didn't have a clearly structured narrative when he started working on the project.\n\n\"Basically we started digging,\" he says. \"What does it mean, to have no men in the family?\"\n\nBreche wasn't interested in why the village men are absent. Explaining things, he says, is easy. The silence is more important.\n\nShouf à la arthouse\n\nThe way Riverbed looks and moves is in line with conventions common in international arthouse cinema. These include an appreciation of fixed camera shots, long takes and striking exterior locations.\n\nSilence, too, is loved. It's impressive how much the film is able to convey -- both dramatically and comically -- with relatively little dialogue. Between its reticent characters, sparks of dry comedy, and picturesque rural photography, Riverbed is reminiscent of the early work of Turkish auteur Nuri Bilge Ceylan.\n\n\"I've used lots of dialogue in my series,\" Breche says. \"Here I didn't want to do that. Silence is a way of being true to the story's location -- the people in this village don't speak a lot. The silence is also faithful to the cinema that I love. I want the picture to speak, to express feelings. I don't want to use words.\n\n\"In the film's sound design, the cinematography, the details, we made a whole world to help the words be as effective as they can be. If you have one sentence in 15 minutes, this sentence is probably gonna stick in your head.\"\n\nCarole Abboud and Rabih El Zahr in a still from Bassem Breche's 'Riverbed.' (Courtesy of The Attic Productions)\n\nThese silences, and the shards of communication that sometimes slice through them, are complemented by a counterpoint of nondescript locations (whether interior rooms or the village's frayed scenery) and spectacular exteriors.\n\nA woman and her lover are reduced to incidental detail by the mountain range behind them and its reflection, mirrored in the lake surface before them. Elsewhere in the film, Salma walks across an outdoor basketball court, where four players jog in place, prompted by a whistle-blowing coach.\n\nBreche says that when he and cinematographer Nadim Saoma scouted locations, they were on familiar terrain.\n\n\"I knew from the start that the film -- the story of this woman and the daughter who returns -- would unfold inside Salma's house. I also knew that I want to leave this house. Nadim and I spent four or five months in the area, living there visiting locations. We filmed in the areas that I know best -- from the mountain scenes, where Salma meets her lover, to Birakat al-Arous [the mountain stream that lends its name to the film's Arabic title]. That area's very dear to me. It's more than beauty. It's poetry. It's ugly too, in places.\"\n\nBreche tips his hat to two senior filmmakers in the film's credits. One is Salhab, his co-writer and theother is Palestinian auteur Elia Suleiman, whom he says was uninvolved in production. Breche regards both these filmmakers as mentors, but their roles have been quite distinct.\n\n\"Elia's work made me become a filmmaker,\" Breche says. \"I didn't know him, and only met him recently in fact. I was studying theater and was supposed to go become a dancer. Then one day I watched Elia's film Divine Intervention. I was amazed. You can do this? with cinema? Later we became friends.\n\nOmaya Malaeb and Bassem Breche in a production shot from 'Riverbed.' (Courtesy of The Attic Productions)\n\n\"I approached Ghassan first and told him, 'Listen, I have this script I'm thinking of. If you like it, I would like you to join.' He told me he was very busy but said he would read it. He did, and he decided to work with me on it. It was a two-year journey, not only writing but learning how to make films. Ghassan is very particular in the way he sees cinema. I agree with him on lots of things, but we disagree on things too. Elia and Ghassan are mentors, and we're friends.\"\n\nBreche says he received some blowback about the story he's chosen for his first feature, though at that point no one had actually seen Riverbed and its compassionate depiction of its lead characters.\n\n\"I've been getting a lot of 'Why are you, a man, coming now and telling a story of two women?'\" he says. \"I started making this film way before #MeToo.\n\n\"I think, yes, as men we have to sit and listen to what women have to say.\" He pauses. \"That doesn't mean we don't have a point of view to share.\"",

          "body": "Yesterday's battle featured a seeded namesake versus an unseeded alleged tax cheat.\n\nDoug brought up an intriguing idea:\n\nOne of the pluses for Milne was his qualifying in multiple categories. You may have to give this one to Shakira given the lyrics to Hips Don't Lie, which has \"Shakira Shakira\" in the first verse. Though Dan brings up a good point about Mr. Beetlejuice, not to mention Keaton starring in the movie \"Multiplicity\", where he replicated himself. Reifying replication!\n\nUnfortunately this works for both candidates so it doesn't help us make the decistion.\n\nDespite personally being a huge Michael Keaton fan -- I'd definitely go to hear him speak! -- I had to go with the strongest argument, which came from Raghu:\n\nI don't really care about either of them, but as I am currently in a boring part of a Zoom meeting I visited Skakira's home page, which has a large button marked \"Discover Shakira's Perfumes.\" I did not click, but nonetheless it led me to think: (1) hopefully the finals of this matchup will be in person and not online, and (2) given that, I would rather discover Shakira's perfume than Michael Keaton's perfume.\n\nThis comment hit the spot, given our recent interest in non-visual graphical display. It also made me wonder: if you click on a perfume button during a zoom meeting and you aren't muted, will a pleasant smell waft out from the speakers of everyone else's computers?\n\nAnd Owen writes:\n\nI'd love to hear from the wild boar that stole Shakira's handbag; perhaps they could make a cameo alongside her?\n\nWe'll see how Shakira fares in the second round when she faces the juggernaut that is A. A. Milne.\n\nToday's matchup\n\nJames Naismith is second-seeded in the \"Creators of laws or rules\" category . . . I guess you've all heard of him. John Adams is the composer who shares the name of a famous revolutionary.\n\nIn preparation for this competition I went to the library and borrowed a record of music by John Adams, also got something by John Luther Adams, the composer whose claim to fame is that he shares a name with a more famous composer, who shares a name with, etc. Neither Adams's music appealed to my taste. But you can be a composer of dissonant, tuneless music and still be a good speaker, right? Or, to put it another way, give James Naismith a banjo or whatever and he might sound even worse. And Adams might have a killer two-handed set shot.",

She was absolutely amazing in there,\" said Frankie Bridge on Instagram.\n\n\"Aww, just seen Charlene White is leaving. You did yourself proud, you can get home and squeeze those babies!\" said Nadia Sawalha.\n\nKaye Adams went on: \"Charlene White you should feel very proud of what you achieved. Never easy being the first out... I should know! Can't wait to have you back in the studio and reunited with your babies!\"\n\n\"Charlene missed her babies. She stuck to her principles,\" said Denise Welch on Twitter. \"People have very short memories regarding Hancock. I'm very proud of my friends Charlene and Sue.\"\n\nHer exit came after Charlene failed to do well in the Bushtucker trial last night.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking during her eviction interview, Charlene said: \"It was emotional. To use that ridiculous American phrase, It has been a journey, and I've absolutely loved living with those guys.\n\n\"Every single one of those guys have been great.\"\n\nOn sharing the jungle with disgraced MP Matt Hancock, the ITV broadcaster said she wanted to remain impartial and commented: \"Well I think my money was on him or Liz Truss in terms of which one you guys were going to convince to come on.\n\n\"I was surprised but not surprised, I may well be in the jungle but journalism is my first job.\"\n\nShe sipped on her glass of champagne and added: \"I wanted to ask questions that people on the outside had.\n\n\"We had to live alongside him and adapt to that. He's made some connections in there which is wonderful.\"\n\nCharlene also addressed the controversy around sleeping arrangements in the camp, after she refused to sleep in the RV with Matt.\n\nThe mum-of-two added: \"I just think it would be really difficult to do the job that I will continue doing after I leave here once I have spent the night with a politician. Not in that way!\"\n\nViewers reacted to the elimination on Twitter, and one penned: \"I thought Charlene was amazing.\"\n\nAnother fan wrote after Charlene spent 14 days in the jungle: \"I like charlene sorry to see her go and disappointed!\"\n\nMike Tindall earlier delivered the news that the public had been voting all night for their favourite celebs to stay on the show.\n\nThe ex rugby star read the news from a laminate note and said: \"Celebrities, tonight is your last night together. Tomorrow one of you will be the first to leave the jungle.\"\n\nEach campmate then stood up and delivered an emotional tribute to their time in the camp together, before heading to bed.\n\nAnt and Dec entered the jungle camp early in the morning, and in live scenes they told the stars who had been saved.\n\nMike, Scarlette Douglas, Seann Walsh, Babtunde Aleshe, Jill Scott, Owen Waner and Chris Moyles breathed a sigh of relief as they learned they'd survived.\n\nBoy George and Matt Hancock were also saved - after their row earlier in the episode.\n\nAnt told them Charlene and Coronation Street star Sue Cleaver were at risk, before revealing the Loose Women host was given the boot.",

Referring to certain estimates that this would result in up to 90,000 private school pupils switching to state schools, he failed to mention that this statistic came from a 2018 report by the Independent Schools Council lobby group.\n\nDr Malcolm James, senior lecturer in accounting and taxation at Cardiff Metropolitan University, who has published research on private school tax breaks and rising fees in the sector, said: He seems only to have looked at evidence from the ISC but, of course, they would say that, wouldnt they?\n\nJames said many families with children at private school would have no problem affording a 10% increase in fees, and schools would step in to help those who struggled to do so.",

The Athletic reported Harrell took the ball from Antetokounmpo and wouldn't give it back before telling Antetokounmpo, \"This isn't (expletive) Milwaukee. Get that (expletive) out of here.\"\n\nCoaching staff member Josh Love then stood between the two and told Antetokounmpo he could not have the basketball back and was not allowed to continue shooting free throws, per The Athletic.\n\nAfter leaving the court, Antetokounmpo returned with not one but two basketballs and went to the other end of the court. An A-frame ladder was in front of the net he wanted to use and Antetokounmpo asked the Wells Fargo Center employee to move it, to which he was told no.\n\nAntetokounmpo took matters into his own hands and moved it before the employee moved it back. Antetokounmpo then shoved the ladder as it fell to the ground and later told reporters he likes to make 10 free throws in a row after games and he was at seven and wanted to finish up his routine.\n\n\"I never try to disrespect anyone, in any way shape or form,\" Antetokounmpo told reporters after the game, per The Athletic. \"I feel like today was just unfortunate event that took place. I think people did not respect the fact that sometimes players want to get some extra work in. I think it's unprofessional to kick somebody off the court or take the ball or whatever the case might be. Or put the ladder in front of somebody while he's trying to do his job. We get paid to do this. They didn't just pick us. We get paid.\"",

          "body": "Both Pokémon Scarlet and Violet feature a wide array of great bug-type Pokémon, many of which are capable of facing some of the game's top tiers, like the Bug/Dark type Lokix, the evolved form of Nimble. But where can you catch a Nimble in the games? Now, in order to answer that and more, here's how to catch a Nymble in both Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.\n\nJust like most Pokemon available in the games, such as Wattrel, Bramblin, and Sinistea, you can find a few Nymble across many areas. More specifically, as you can see in the image below, Nymble can be found all over the westmost portion of the Paldea region, as well as in a relatively small area located east of Mesagoza.\n\nWith that said, we were able to find a Nimble on the cliffs located directly ahead of Afornada City, in the southmost part of the Paldea continent map. More specifically on the intersection between South Province (Area Four) and West Province (Area 1), facing South Province (Area Six). The Nimble in the area will be around lv 14-17 so they should not be a problem. Once you spot the Pokémon, just battle them in order to capture them and add them to your roster.\n\nYou can check out the exact location where we were able to catch a Nymble in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet below:\n\nNow that you know where to find a Nimble in both Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, don't forget to check out how to Evolve Nymble into Lokix so that you can quickly get the already mentioned Dark type, assemble your dream team, and complete the Paldea Pokédex as fast as possible.",

          "title": "Man arrested in Los Angeles recruits crash is released",
          "body": "By JOHN ANTCZAK and AMY TAXIN - Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- Citing the need for further investigation, authorities released a 22-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a peace officer after the SUV he was driving veered into the wrong lane and crashed into Los Angeles County law enforcement recruits on a training run, injuring 25 of them.\n\nNicholas Joseph Gutierrez, of Diamond Bar, was released late Thursday. NBC4LA broadcast footage of him arriving home and reported that he didn't answer any questions.\n\n\"Due to the extreme complexity of the investigation, which includes ongoing interviews, video surveillance review, and additional evidence needed to be analyzed, homicide investigators have released Mr. Gutierrez from the Sheriff's Department custody today at approximately 9:55 PM,\" the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in a statement.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The group included two law enforcement vehicles and eight road guards wearing reflective vests, as well as drill instructors who are sworn officers, authorities said.\n\nFive of the recruits were critically injured and two remained in critical condition Thursday afternoon, according to the department.\n\nSheriff Alex Villanueva said at a news conference a few hours after the crash that \"so far, it looks like it's an accident, a horrific accident,\" but Gutierrez was arrested later that afternoon.\n\nVillanueva told NewsNation on Thursday that investigators believe the crash was a \"deliberate act\" and that there was probable cause to make the arrest.\n\nBut he said Gutierrez was going to be \"provisionally\" released \"until we can have the case iron clad, iron proof, and submitted to the DA for filing consideration. Right now, we want to tie up all the loose ends on the case and then present it to the DA.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt that an in-depth investigation will confirm that Nicholas is a hard-working young man who holds no animosity towards law enforcement, and this was an absolutely tragic accident,\" Alexandra Kazarian, Gutierrez's attorney, said in a statement to KABC-TV.\n\nChristine Periman, who lives near the crash site, said she woke up to a devastating scene unfolding outside her home early Wednesday with recruits scattered along the street and one victim whose leg was turning blue.\n\n\"It seemed like the sirens just kept coming for about two hours,\" she said. \"It was just horrific.\"\n\nShe said the recruits regularly ran by her home, and teared up thinking they might not anymore.\n\nIt will be up to the county district attorney to decide whether Gutierrez will be charged and for what offense. Gutierrez could not be reached for comment and it was unclear if he has a lawyer.\n\nThe case has not been formally referred to the district attorney's office for prosecution. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said in an email that sheriff's and highway patrol authorities advised late Thursday that they wouldn't be presenting a case at this time and that the suspect would be released.\n\nSome had questioned whether sheriff's authorities were being overzealous in moving so quickly to arrest Gutierrez for investigation of the attempted murder of a peace officer.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, the sheriff has had a long-running dispute with the district attorney, George Gascón. Gascón was elected to his office as a progressive reformer and his critics have blasted him as being soft on crime.\n\nIn the NewsNation interview, Villanueva -- who conceded defeat earlier this week in his own reelection bid -- referenced the tensions with Gascón, saying \"we definitely have grave concerns about his ability to prosecute.\"\n\nLaurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and criminal law professor at Loyola Law School who isn't affiliated with the case, said attempted murder usually means there was intent to kill and the driver wasn't simply distracted or didn't lose control of the vehicle.\n\nIn an interview before the driver's release, Levenson also said a key question is whether the sheriff's department can perform an objective evaluation given that the agency's recruits were victims of the crash. That's why it's also important that prosecutors review the evidence and ultimately be the ones who decide, she added.\n\n\"They've gone after the highest possible charge -- there is no doubt about it,\" Levenson said of investigators. \"The question is whether they are objective enough in evaluating this given that the crime was committed against their own. We've got to see what the evidence shows.\"\n\nAuthorities said a field sobriety test performed on the driver was negative.\n\nRory Little, a professor at UC Hastings College of Law, said having sheriff's authorities take a closer look at the evidence could signal that an agency is being appropriately cautious, not a need for suspicion. Larger law enforcement agencies typically don't have trouble finding investigators not associated with a case to work on it, he said.\n\n\"If the sheriff's department actually said 'wait a minute, slow down here,' that's probably a good reflection on the department,\" Little said. \"It's too early to judge anything.\"\n\nTaxin reported from Orange County, California.

          "title": "Dodgers Rumors: LA Reportedly Interested in Free Agent Centerfielder to Replace Bellinger",
          "body": "Center-fielder Kevin Kiermaier, who had his option declined by the Rays last week, could be on the Dodgers' radar as a partial replacement for the recently non-tendered Cody Bellinger.\n\nWith Cody Bellinger non-tendered, the Dodgers find themselves with an opening in center field. While they've shown interest in bringing Bellinger back and also have internal options such as Chris Taylor, Trayce Thompson, and James Outman, they could look outside the organization for Bellinger's replacement.\n\nIf they go for outside help, there's one intriguing name on the free-agent market.\n\nKevin Kiermaier has spent his entire 10-year career with Tampa Bay, but the Rays declined their team option on the three-time Gold Glove winner last week. Kiermaier was once the premier defensive center-fielder in baseball, but his defensive numbers were down across the board in 2022, with career worsts in defensive runs saved, outs above average, UZR/150, and defensive WAR.\n\nKiermaier will be 33 in April, and it's understandable to think his defense won't return to its former glory as he ages, but his 2022 season was hampered by a hip injury that eventually required a season-ending surgery in August. By all accounts his surgery went well, so he could be back to his elite roaming of the outfield next year.\n\nThe bigger issue with Kiermaier is that he's never been much of a hitter. His career OPS+ is 98, so he's just below average offensively. That's plenty valuable if you're providing Gold Glove defense, and if he was sandwiched by, say, Mookie Betts in right field and Aaron Judge in left field, you'd absolutely take elite defense and average offense in center field. And, of course, it's worth noting that league-average offense in center field would be a huge step up from what L.A. got from Bellinger the last two years.\n\nKiermaier has had 500 plate appearances in a season just once in his 10 years, so he's not someone any team will count on to be an everyday center-fielder. But he could be a fit for the Dodgers in the right situation.",

          "body": "By CAROLYN THOMPSON - Associated Press\n\nBUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Residents of northern New York state were digging out Saturday morning from a dangerous lake-effect snowstorm that had dropped nearly 6 feet of snow in some areas and caused three deaths.\n\nThe Buffalo metro area was hit particularly hard, with some areas south of the city receiving more than 5 feet of snow by early Saturday. About 80 miles (129 kilometers) northeast of the city, the town of Natural Bridge, near the Fort Drum Army base, reported just under 6 feet.\n\nThe National Weather Service predicted partial sunshine in some areas but more snow showers through Sunday evening before mixing with rain by Monday.\n\nThe inundation forced the National Football League to move Sunday's game between the Buffalo Bills and Cleveland Browns to Detroit from the Bills' home stadium in the Buffalo suburb of Orchard Park.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Hamlet is about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from Lake Michigan.\n\nThe storm's effects varied widely in the region due to the peculiarities of lake-effect storms, which are caused by frigid winds picking up moisture from warmer lakes and dumping snow in narrow bands. Some areas of Buffalo were battered by blowing, heavy snow off Lake Erie while mere miles away, residents only had to contend with a few inches.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency Thursday for parts of western New York, including communities along the eastern ends of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The declaration covers 11 counties, with all vehicles banned from a stretch of Interstate 90.\n\nBuffalo has experience with dramatic lake-effect snowstorms, few worse than the one that struck in November 2014. That epic storm dumped 7 feet (2 meters) of snow on some communities over three days, collapsing roofs and trapping motorists in more than 100 vehicles on a lakeside stretch of the New York State Thruway.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

          "body": "Around 92% of the total quantity of tea was sold at the latest tea auction held in Kochi, fetching an average price of ₹181.02 a kg\n\nTea export from south India, which had been sluggish since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, has picked up with buyers evincing interest ahead of the onset of winter in Europe. Around 92% of the total quantity of tea -- both Orthodox leaf and CTC leaf -- put up for sale was sold in the latest tea auction held in Kochi, fetching an average price of ₹181.02 per kg.\n\nDuring the initial days of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, the unsold quantity had touched record heights, around 40%-50%, with buyers abstaining from the bidding following market uncertainty. The shipping lines had then increased freight charges, considering the risks involved in a war-torn region. But now, countries like Russia are increasing their stocks as it would be difficult for ships to deliver consignments to key destinations on time during winter.\n\nCrisis in Sri Lanka\n\nFurther, the political and economic uncertainty in Colombo played a part in salvaging the south Indian tea sector, said R. Sanjith, secretary of United Planters Association of Southern India's (UPASI). \"As per the latest market reports, there was a shortage of around 42.3 million kg in the average tea production of Sri Lanka. This turned importers' attention to auctions in south India. Global factors have contributed to the present surge in the export volume of tea from here,\" said Mr. Sanjith. The Sri Lankan crisis also helped the market of CTC dust to strengthen its position, with 87% of the total quantity put up for sale being sold in the last auction, according to an auctioneer.\n\nAccording to the auctioneers Forbes, Ewart & Figgis, the demand for the Orthodox leaf and CTC leaf is likely to continue from overseas destinations like CIS countries, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey.",

But the promise was 40 per cent or 2.4 million votes from the mountain.\" Sifuna shared.\n\nAccording to the Nairobi senator, Jubilee negotiated serious concessions, all of which it blew up with Azimio losing out on all slots that he shared.\n\nIn the arrangement, Mount Kenya bagged the running mate slot with Martha Karua becoming Raila Odinga's running mate.\n\nThe Nairobi governor slot was also handed to Jubilee with Polycarp Igathe flying the Azimio flag.\n\n\"Jubilee overpromised and under delivered whilst also extracting serious concessions including a Mount Kenya running mate, Nairobi governor and over 50 percent of government.\" Stated the Nairobi Senator.\n\nSifuna made the revelations in the wake of a fallout in Azimio after Jubilee Secretary Jeremiah Kioni, and former Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu, warmed up to Kenya Kwanza.\n\nInsiders believe that the fallout was sparked by East Africa Legislative Assembly nomination slots and subsequent voting in parliament.\n\n\"It was not planned. It just happened naturally. The vote in parliament taught us that we are on our own. It is not about politics or individuals. We want to ensure the nation and our people are okay,\" Kioni stated.\n\n\"We are in a new reality. Yesterday (Thursday, November 17), we continued discussing our role under this new dispensation. We agreed that, fundamentally, we must seek to add value wherever we can.\n\n\"We must also do whatever we can to help this government succeed, because its success is ultimately our success, as we are part of the Kenyan community,\" Wambugu stated after meeting a section of 2022 poll losers.\n\nRetired President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader, Raila Odinga are yet to comment on the matter.",

          "body": "© (Photo by Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images) KEY WORDS\n\nLoad Error\n\nBillionaire Jeff Bezos, who founded the e-tail behemoth Amazon, has some spending tips as Americans gear up for the holiday shopping season -- amid four-decade-high inflation and recession worries.\n\nHere's what he said:\n\n'If you're an individual and you're thinking about buying a large-screen TV, maybe slow that down, keep that cash, see what happens. Same thing with a refrigerator, a new car, whatever. Just take some risk off the table.'\n\nBezos made the comments in a CNN interview that aired this week, the same interview in which he pledged to give away most of his fortune in his lifetime.\n\nWhy did Bezos offer the tip for consumers and small business to go easy on big-ticket items? He provided one big reason.\n\n\"If we're not in a recession right now, we're likely to be in one very soon,\" he said in the interview, picking up on a cautionary tweet last month that \"the probabilities in this economy tell you to batten down the hatches.\"\n\nBezos is currently executive chair at Amazon transitioning to the role last year as Andy Jassy took up the CEO reins.\n\nAmazon went on to confirm it was laying off some of its staff in its device and services business -- joining a growing list of tech companies, including Facebook parent Meta -- in eliminating large numbers of jobs. Amazon's job cuts could number around 10,000, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nCritics have taken aim at these words of thrift coming from a man who built Amazon into the 800-pound gorilla of U.S. online shopping and is personally worth some $120 billion.\n\nTo be sure, Bezos is not alone is his worries about a potential recession as the Federal Reserve and other central banks fight higher costs by hiking interest rates.\n\nBut his advice prompted some guffaws on social media. In a nutshell, critics say these words of thrift are a bit rich coming from a man -- Bezos is now worth approximately $120 billion -- who built Amazon into an online megabazaar where consumers are encouraged to seamlessly spend money.\n\nAs Joshua Becker, a proponent of minimalism, wrote on Twitter: \"I didn't hear him mention refraining from Amazon's Prime Day deals or Black Friday offers, but I recommend adding those items to your list as well.\"\n\nRegardless of how one feels about receiving spending advice, including from one of the world's wealthiest people, there are worthwhile considerations as holiday shopping promotions ramp up.\n\nFor one thing, maybe there are discretionary expenses where people can cut back. Many Americans are still spending briskly, as Walmart third-quarter earnings and October's retail-sales numbers recently affirmed. Holiday spending projections paint the same picture.\n\nAmericans will spend between $942.6 billion and $960.4 billion this holiday season, according to projections from the National Retail Federation. Holiday sales last year totaled $889.3 billion, the trade association said.\n\nDuring the third quarter, Americans' credit-card balances climbed to $930 billion, the biggest annual increase in more than 20 years, according to the National Retail Federation.\n\nBut Americans are planning for the holidays even as credit-card balances are increasing -- likely because credit cards are helping many people keep pace with rising costs.\n\nDuring the third quarter, Americans' credit-card balances climbed to $930 billion, the biggest annual increase in more than 20 years, according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York data.\n\nWhile balances grow, so do credit-card interest rates. The annual percentage rate, or APR, on new credit-card offers averaged 19.14% in mid-November, according to Bankrate.com. That beats the old record on APRs for new cards: 19%, three decades ago.\n\nThe holiday shopping season is typically when Americans accumulate credit-card debt, paying those debts in the early part of the following year and repeating the process at the end of that year.\n\nThis year, the stakes are higher amid risk that credit-card bills could arrive and a recession-induced job loss follow. \"It's not the time to overspend and have a problem with paying your bills later,\" Michele Raneri, vice president of financial-services research and consulting at TransUnion one of the country's three major credit bureaus, has told MarketWatch. \"We know the economy is sending mixed messages.\"\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

Human Rights Council next week.\n\n\"They have two goals by attributing the killing of the protesters to terrorist groups like Daesh,\" Amiry-Moghaddam said.\n\n\"They want to use it as an excuse for more widespread use of live ammunition,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"And they also want to influence countries in the U.N.

Almost half (47 percent) said they had seen an increase in demand for substance use treatment (up from 43 percent in 2021), and almost two-thirds (64 percent) saw an increase in demand for trauma treatment. In 2022, two-thirds of psychologists reported seeing an increase in the severity of symptoms among patients. Sixty percent of respondents said they no longer have openings for new patients, nearly half (46 percent) reported being unable to meet the demand for treatment, and nearly three-quarters (72 percent) said they have longer waitlists than before the pandemic.\n\n\"Having timely access to psychological services is critical for addressing the needs of those diagnosed with behavioral health challenges,\" APA CEO Arthur C. Evans Jr., Ph.D., said in a statement. \"We need to support and expand the workforce, promote integrated behavioral health into primary care, improve mental health literacy, use technology and innovation to expand reach and improve efficiency. But critically, we must expand our paradigm for addressing behavioral health -- especially if we are to successfully address health disparities -- by using more public health strategies to reach people earlier and in the places where they live, work, play, and worship.\"\n\nMore Information",

          "body": "BEIRUT -- Lebanon's Tourism Ministry announced Saturday that it requested hospitality venues to declare the entrance fees they will charge customers who wish to watch World Cup matches.\n\nThe ministry asked for the fees to be declared \"for monitoring and control purposes,\" caretaker Tourism Minister Walid Nassar told L'Orient Today.\n\nThe request comes one day before Sunday's World Cup kickoff, which will take place in Qatar until Dec. 18. Nassar clarified to L'Orient Today that entrance fees have always been imposed by bars, cafes and hotels -- not by the ministry -- during World Cup games over the years, \"in order to cover the broadcasting subscription.\"\n\n\"The fee used to be calculated into the bill,\" Nassar said. \"Since the institutions tend to price randomly as they wish ... we released a statement reminding them about the regulations and the law. They cannot charge customers however they want, so they need to release their price list and present it to the [Tourism] Ministry so that we can impose our control.\"\n\nHowever, the Tourism Minister said he cannot reveal the price range or limits that such institutions will charge for the games until they declare their fees.\n\nL'Orient Today contacted the heads of different touristic syndicates to ask how the institutions plan to implement entrance fees, but no one was immediately available for comment.\n\nOn Nov. 8, the Federation of Young Lebanese Businessmen and Women (FYBL) announced in a statement that it contacted the caretaker ministers Ziad Makari and Walid Nassar, calling on them to \"intervene in order to secure the broadcasting of matches in touristic establishments\" in return for a fee \"that takes into account the economic conditions\" of the country.\n\nTransparency of fees\n\nIn a statement released Saturday, the Tourism Ministry said the entrance fees will be \"determined according to what the institution provides, during the match broadcasting period, after submitting to the Tourism Ministry a copy of the price list in Arabic and English to obtain approval,\" adding that it also \"requests all institutions to clearly announce the above-mentioned price lists at their entrances, in order to preserve transparency between tourism institutions and their customers.\"\n\nAccording to Nassar, the ministry is striving to implement a \"fixed\" rate policy for each restaurant or cafe, where the bar or cafe charges the same fee on all days regardless of which match is being televised, but the fee will likely differ between different establishments.\n\nSama Group -- the broadcaster of the beIN Sports channel -- has so far been reluctant to release its broadcasting price list set for commercial institutions.\n\n\"Prices are given on a case-by-case basis and vary according to a range from $3,000 to $50,000,\" the customer service department told L'Orient-Le Jour.\n\n\"The customer must present the capacity of his establishment and, after verification on-site by the group, is offered a price that also depends on its location,\" a Beirut-based reseller, who preferred to remain anonymous, explained. \"For example, a restaurant located in Mansourieh, in the suburbs of Beirut, will pay less than another located in Raoucheh, on the coast of the capital.\"\n\n\"The broadcasting license varies between $5,000 and $15,000, depending on the commercial space,\" said Tony Rami, president of the syndicate of owners of restaurants, nightclubs, cafes and pastry shops in Lebanon.",

Their efforts are to get the average unthinking person to believe that \"orange man is bad\".\n\nOn the other hand, they almost never report on his successes. While running for President they ignored the large crowds who showed up for him at every rally. They still do. Only a handful of honest media outlets report on the President's rallies and massive crowds (e.g. OAN, RSBN, and The Gateway Pundit).\n\nPresident Trump's successes with the economy and foreign policy were so good that they were arguably the best ever. His economy was on fire after eight years of Obama's America last economy. President Trump lowered taxes and made America energy independent and the economy soared. Real wages increased while inflation was almost nonexistent.\n\nPresident Trump put in place trade deals that were good for America, destroyed ISIS, created peace deals in the Middle East, and showed China was nothing more than a paper tiger.\n\nThe media rarely reported on his successes, but this corrupt media was happy and earnest in reporting on the many lies about the President colluding with Russia. The corrupt DOJ made up crimes against him and the media was happy to report them. These were all lies. We now know Hillary and Obama were behind these bogus claims and instituted them to keep the focus on President Trump and not on their many crimes.\n\nThen came the 2020 Election where the results in numerous swing states never should have been certified. The media ignored the obvious crimes and corruption that led to the results used to steal the election from President Trump. The media went silent.\n\nBig Tech this whole time was slowly and then quickly censoring conservatives. Eventually, they kicked the President of the United States off their platforms, Donald Trump.\n\nThe President, his supporters, and conservative publications are beneath the media and Big Tech. These huge media giants work together to decide what is true. They are the owners of the information like the media in communist and fascist regimes.\n\nLee Smith recently shared that our US mainstream media is something much different than what we think it is.\n\nThe media is more like an arm of the Intelligence Community.\n\n\"We're Looking at Something Very Different - The Press Being Part of the Intelligence Community\" - Lee Smith Describes the Latest Role of the Fake News (VIDEO)\n\nThe Intelligence Community believes they are the truth, they run this country, and they decide what to share and what not to.

          "body": "BRAZIL boast the most impressive history of a team in the World Cup.\n\nThe Brazilians are the only team with five titles, and the only international side that never failed to qualify for the tournament.\n\nEven when they're not living their best days, they must be considered one of the favourite teams to lift the trophy.\n\nNeymar is always surrounded by controversies, especially in his homeland.\n\nGET £40 WORLD CUP BONUS WITH 888SPORT\n\nAfter the rising star of Brazil helped Real Madrid on their quest to win their 14 Champions League title, some renowned journalists in Brazil considered that the big name of Brazil in the 2022 World Cup is Vinicius Jr and not Neymar.\n\nThe manager of Brazil, however, doesn't have to make a choice and will most likely use both players are regulars.\n\nBut the boys from Brazil will have to overcome some challenges to lift their sixth World Cup trophy.\n\nHOW TO GET FREE BETS ON THE WORLD CUP\n\nIf we consider the last months of the Brazilian team, then this would be the expected starting XI, featuring big names like Thiago Silva, Alisson, Casemiro, the rising stars Vinicius Jr. and Raphinha, and Neymar.\n\nHowever, the last friendlies against Tunisia and Ghana showed that Tite has different variations in his mind.\n\nThe test with Neymar as a midfielder was proof that he's scratching his head to define a regular team.\n\nThis question is easy to understand, but hard to solve: where to use Neymar and Vini Jr? Both players are best used as left-wingers.\n\nNeymar, however, has shown versatility since his early days playing for Santos in Brazil prior to his transfer to Barcelona.\n\nBack when he was very young, he had already proven that he could help his teammates with lots of assists, and also score many goals.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise in the last weeks was the good form of Alex Telles.\n\nThe Manchester United loanee is living good days in Spain playing for Sevilla.\n\nThere's a chance he could become the regular left-back when the Brazilians face Serbia in their first game of the group stage.\n\nFREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS - BEST NEW CUSTOMER OFFERS\n\nWhen the Brazilians attack, the midfielders and attackers tend to rotate a lot and try to confuse the opposing defenders.\n\nNeymar and Vini Jr. are players that leave their positions when they are left winger and often run across the box - scoring goals from the usual areas where strikers, right-wingers and attacking midfielders usually appear.\n\nThis is, in fact, Brazil's greatest strength and weakness.\n\nSometimes the change of positions in the attacking phase creates space to shoot and creates confusion.\n\nBut sometimes, in big games like the last Copa America final, against the defence of a stronger team, this kind of style doesn't work as well as you'd think.\n\nBetter teams are less prone to be pulled out of position and this means there isn't space to create the scoring chance.\n\nMoreover, it depends a lot on the good form of players like Neymar to work perfectly.\n\nBrazil has great squad depth, but they rely a lot on their biggest star.\n\nAnd as their biggest rivals Argentina have shown us over the years, relying on your No 10 all the time does not make a World Cup-winning team.\n\nBrazil uses a lot of the space between the defenders and the midfielders, as well as the wings, and lower tier teams have a hard time trying to adjust their man marking.\n\nBrazil has been playing in a very dominant way in the last few years.\n\nThey focus on having the ball possession in the attacking third, and their defensive moments usually don't last long, as they work fast after recovering the ball, organizing quick counterattacks that rely on the speed of their world-class wingers.\n\nThey have great defenders like Thiago Silva, Marquinhos and Casemiro to help them recover the ball quickly meaning they can get back into dangerous positions quickly.\n\nBelow, as Argentina, begin their build-up on the left-hand side, Brazil shift their entire high block over.\n\nThe press is initially led by two players, and as the ball is played to either side, one player will pressure the centre-back while the other tucks in on the opposition's defensive midfielder.\n\nWith their block moved over, they adopt a man-to-man press and aim to keep the opposition from progressing into the midfield third.\n\nThe Brazilians are in line with modern football techniques and they work hard to recover the ball when the opponent has it in their defensive third. Yes, it's another high press.\n\nWhen Brazil doesn't have the ball, a 4-4-2 formation is often used.\n\nAfter recovering the ball, the team focuses on using the spaces between the lines.\n\nThe transitions between defence and attack are a strong point of this team, especially between the midfield and the attackers.\n\nThe midfield block and the attackers fuse into a strong block of players that confuses the opposition.\n\nThe great quality of the players makes it easy for the player with the ball to find someone to pass the ball to quickly and effectively.\n\nBrazil attack with great speed when they have the opportunity to counterattack.\n\nThe fast action after the recovery of the ball is a big asset of this team, and being able to give it to Vini Jr or Rodrygo or Neymar etc does help really.\n\nBrazil always has great attackers and this team is no exception. Richarlison, Vini Jr, Raphinha and Neymar are in top form. This area is certainly the strongest one in Tite's squad.\n\nCasemiro is a very important player in this team as he is experienced and won lots of trophies with Real Madrid before joining Manchester United.\n\nPaquetá may not be as famous, but he has been called often by Tite and is an important part of his system.\n\nIf Tite decides to use Raphinha, Vini Jr, and Richarlison as regulars, we may even see Neymar as a midfielder during the World Cup - as has been experimented with recently.\n\nThe regular defenders are an important part of this team. Thiago Silva and Marquinhos form a solid part of their defensive system.\n\nAlex Telles is also performing well and may become a regular during the tournament.\n\nÉder Militão is also a useful player as he has been used as a right-back too in the last friendlies, which gives them some versatility.\n\nNeymar is a powerhouse of assists and goals and everyone knows that.\n\nHe is displaying such a commitment during the PSG games prior to the World Cup - as he tries to show Tite and the Brazilian press that he's serious about this World Cup.\n\nNeymar is always surrounded by controversies, especially in France, but his numbers prior to the tournament are great.\n\nIt's true that Ligue 1 isn't as competitive as La Liga, his former domestic league, but it's only fair to say that he's doing all he can to arrive in Qatar in top form.\n\nIf he can allow himself to share the limelight with some of Brazil's other attacking stars, things could come together nicely.\n\nThe Brazilians certainly are one of the favourites to win the World Cup, together with France and England.\n\nBrazil is expected to qualify for the Round of 16, as always, although their group has teams of intermediate quality like Serbia and Switzerland, which means they'll be properly challenged before they face the knockout stage.\n\nThis challenge could be good for the South Americans, to prepare for tougher games on their quest to lift their sixth World Cup.",

          "title": "Teen targeted Indian restaurant and warehouse in crime spree",
          "body": "A teenager kicked in the doors of an Indian restaurant then stole cash from a warehouse. Jay Storey from Cwmbran was abusing substances during a crime spree that included stealing cars and burgling homes, a court heard.\n\nLast year Storey was jailed for nine months over a spate of offences from 2020 when he stole two cars and damaged them as well as burgling Halfords in Cwmbran. And he appeared at Newport Magistrates' Court on Thursday to be sentenced for three more crimes from around the same time. The court heard a police error had caused the two-year delay.\n\nProsecutor Emma Davies said a witness woke at 12.10am on August 31, 2020, to hear banging on his street, The Highway in New Inn near Pontypool. He looked out of the window and saw the then-18-year-old Storey kicking in the rear doors of a nearby Indian takeaway. Storey, whose face was covered by a helmet, did not take anything from the restaurant but caused £200 worth of damage to the bolts of the double doors.\n\nRead next: Cardiff's Supajump trampoline park admits criminal offences after four people injured\n\nAround an hour later Storey went to the Ultra Coat powder coating warehouse on Woodfield Road. He kicked through the bottom panel of a door and stole about £200 from a drawer as well as the keys to a van.\n\nMs Davies said Storey had also targeted a home in Trostrey, Cwmbran, at 1.45am the day before. \"Two males approach the driveway and are initially looking at the complainant's car,\" she added. \"Then the defendant goes to approach the home's front door and the side light switches on. The pair do seem to be startled by this and look through the kitchen window. The defendant then tries the door handle with his left hand.\"\n\nStorey, of Brangwyn Avenue, failed to break into the home but admitted attempting burglary. The defendant, now 20, also pleaded guilty to the two Pontypool burglaries. The court heard a Stanley knife was found at one of the crime scenes and a police error meant there was a delay in sending it to forensics. None of Storey's DNA was found on the weapon but the mistake caused a two-year delay in the case.\n\nFrancesca Edwards pointed out her client had admitted the offences in 2020 when interviewed by police. \"Respectfully, forensic evidence doesn't take two years to come back for a matter to be brought to court,\" she said.\n\nThe solicitor added that Storey was at the time experiencing \"a degree of separation\" from his family and \"associating with negative peers\". She told the court: \"These were among a string of burglaries being committed at the time, and this was to do with the group he was associating with. His luck ran out and he ended up going to custody in 2021 for nine months. Had these matters been brought before the court then, he would have received concurrent sentences.\"\n\nConcurrent sentences would have meant Storey serving them at the same time rather than being brought before the court again. The nine-month jail term had come after Storey was convicted of 10 offences including handling a stolen Peugeot 208; stealing and damaging a Mitsubishi Mirage and Honda Civic; stealing a Playstation 4; burgling a Halfords store; and attempting to steal from four homes.\n\nMs Edwards added: \"When he was released from custody he was placed in temporary accommodation which he now shares. That has been successful for him. He has managed to obtain employment at a factory in Abergavenny, which will start immediately after the resolution of this case.\n\n\"He has a positive relationship with his partner and no substance misuse issues, which were the issue in the past. The probation service says he has made huge improvements since his release.\"\n\nPresiding Justice Sian Hodges said it would be \"unjust\" to punish Storey with a community order because \"if this had been brought to court before, it would have been dealt with already and you would have probably had concurrent prison sentences, so we're going to give you a conditional discharge for 12 months\".\n\nA conditional discharge means that if Storey commits another crime in the next 12 months he can be sentenced again for the original offences as well as the new one. Mrs Hodges also ordered him to pay £200 in compensation each to the takeaway and warehouse.\n\nShe told Storey: \"We are encouraged by how you seem to be turning your life around. Hopefully you are older and wiser. We don't wish to see you back before the court.\"\n\nStorey, who receives Personal Independence Payments due to learning difficulties, must also pay £85 in prosecution costs and a £22 victim services surcharge. He will pay the debt at a rate of £10 per fortnight.

Yeah, super cool.\"\n\nIt the 75th World Cup win for the four-time overall champion. Only Swedish skiing great Ingemar Stenmark (86) and Vonn (82) have more.\n\nSlalom Olympic champion and last season's World Cup slalom winner Petra Vlhová of Slovakia was third, another four hundredths of a second back.\n\nVlhová took a lead after the first sections of the second run but made a mistake in the steep middle part, while Shiffrin accelerated toward the end for the win.\n\nVlhová and Shiffrin have dominated the field in this Finnish resort in recent years. Both skiers have won five slalom events, meaning the two rivals now have an equal herd of five reindeer, a traditional prize the winner receives in Levi.\n\nNo skier other than Vlhová or Shiffrin has won the traditional season-opening slalom since then-overall champion Tina Maze triumphed in 2014.\n\nShiffrin also won in 2013, '16, '18 and '19.\n\nGermany's Lena Dürr led after the opening run but dropped to fourth, .75 of a second behind Shiffrin, with Switzerland's Wendy Holdener fifth another four hundredths of a second behind.\n\nSlovenia's Ana Bucik placed sixth and giant slalom specialist Sara Hector of Sweden seventh.\n\nAnother American, Ava Sunshine, was 21st.\n\nAmerican skiers Paula Moltzan and AJ Hurt were among 13 skiers who didn't finish the opening round.\n\nUnusually warm weather had prompted all four previously scheduled women's World Cup races to be canceled.\n\nOnly a giant slalom that was slated to open the season in Sölden, Austria, on Oct. 22, was rescheduled for Semmering, Austria, in late December.\n\nThe organizers in Levi, which is located 110 miles north of the Arctic Circle, stored almost 60,000 cubic meters (almost 78,500 cubic yards) of snow on the resort's Black slope in the spring to make sure the races take place.\n\nMore AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/skiing and https://twitter.com/AP -- Sports",

Let's get caught up.Here are today's top stories, celebrity birthdays and a look back at this date in history.\n\n***\n\nTOP STORIES Top headlines for Saturday, Nov. 19 UN climate talks poised for deal creating disaster fund By SETH BORENSTEIN, SAMY MAGDY and FRANK JORDANS - Associated Press Updated 32 min ago\n\nNegotiators say they have struck a potential breakthrough deal on the thorniest issue of United Nations climate talks, creation of a fund for compensating poor nations that are victims of extreme weather worsened by rich nations' carbon pollution. \"There is an agreement on loss and damage,\" which is what negotiators call the concept, Maldives Environment Minister Aminath Shauna told The Associated Press Saturday. It still needs to be approved unanimously in a vote later today.\n\nNational News AP Dangerous lake-effect snow paralyzes parts of New York state By CAROLYN THOMPSON - Associated Press Updated 32 min ago\n\nA dangerous lake-effect snowstorm has paralyzed parts of western and northern New York. More than 5 feet of snow is already on the ground in some places, and authorities are reporting the deaths of two people stricken while clearing snow. The heaviest snowfall as of Friday afternoon was south of the city of Buffalo, where the National Weather Service reported more than 3 feet in many places along the eastern end of Lake Erie. Bands of precipitation brought more than 50 inches to the Buffalo suburb of Orchard Park. Even more snow is expected to fall through the night into Saturday.\n\nLifestyles AP Biden's granddaughter Naomi to marry Saturday at White House By DARLENE SUPERVILLE - Associated Press Updated 32 min ago\n\nPresident Joe Biden's granddaughter, Naomi Biden, and her fiance, Peter Neal, are joining the small club of people who have gotten married at the White House. Their wedding is set for Saturday morning on the South Lawn. It will be the 19th wedding in the 200-plus-year history of the White House. It's the first wedding with a president's granddaughter as the bride. It's also the first held on the lawn. There's lunch inside the White House for the newlyweds, their families and the wedding party after the ceremony. A dessert-and-dancing reception is set for Saturday evening.\n\nGovt-and-politics AP House GOP pushes Hunter Biden probe despite thin majority By COLLEEN LONG - Associated Press Updated 32 min ago\n\nEven with their threadbare House majority, Republicans doubled down this week on using their new power to investigate the Biden administration and in particular the president's son. But their midterms miss has emboldened a White House that has long prepared for this moment. Republicans secured much smaller margins than anticipated, with Biden aides and Democrats feeling like voters punished the GOP for reliance on conspiracy theories and Donald Trump-fueled lies over the 2020 election. Democrats outside the White House have mobilized to combat what they anticipate will be a steady stream of misinformation from the House.\n\nHealth and Fitness Symbol of reunion with China, panda Tuan Tuan dies in Taipei AP Updated 32 min ago\n\nTuan Tuan, one of two giant pandas gifted to Taiwan from China as a symbol of hoped-for reunion between the sides, has died. The Taipei Zoo says Tuan Tuan passed away Saturday afternoon. Earlier reports said the panda was believed to have a malignant brain tumor, prompting China to send a pair of experts to Taiwan earlier this month to help with his treatment. Tuan Tuan and his mate, Yuan Yuan, were gifted to the zoo in 2008 during a time of warming relations between China and Taiwan, which split amid civil war in 1949. Both were born in China in 2004 and succeeded in having a pair of cubs in Taiwan. Ties between Beijing and Taipei have declined sharply since the pair's arrival.\n\nInfantino scolds World Cup critics in extraordinary diatribe By GRAHAM DUNBAR - AP Sports Writer Updated 36 min ago\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino has delivered a one-hour tirade on the eve of the World Cup's opening match and then spent about 45 minutes answering questions from media about the Qatari government's actions and a wide range of other topics. Infantino says he feels gay, feels like a woman and feels like a migrant worker. Infantino later defended the country's immigration policy and praised the government for bringing in migrants to work. He called Europe's criticism of Qatar's policy on migrant workers \"hypocrisy.\" He says \"give them some future. Give them some hope.\"\n\nGovt-and-politics AP UK PM Sunak on surprise trip to Ukraine, meets Zelenskyy By JOHN LEICESTER - Associated Press Updated 17 min ago\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has paid an unannounced visit to Ukraine's snow-blanketed war-time capital for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. They met Saturday in Kyiv. The Ukrainian leader described the two countries as \"the strongest of allies\" and said they discussed \"the most important issues both for our countries and for global security.\" The video he posted showed Zelenskyy greeting Sunak at the presidential palace as snowflakes fell and the two men holding talks. Sunak, speaking alongside the Ukrainian leader, said \"the courage of the Ukrainian people is an inspiration to the world ... in years to come, we will tell our grandchildren of your story.\"\n\n'We survived': Kherson comes alive after Russian withdrawal By HANNA ARHIROVA - Associated Press Updated 36 min ago\n\nResidents of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson can't escape reminders of the terrifying eight months they spent under Russian occupation: missing people, mines everywhere, a scarcity of electricity and water, and explosions day and night as Russian and Ukrainian forces keep battling. Yet despite these hardships, Kherson residents are expressing a mix of relief, optimism, and even joy -- not least because of the freedom they regained a week ago to express themselves at all. People are no longer afraid to leave home, or worried that contact with occupying Russian forces might lead to a prison or torture cell. They are gathering in city squares to recharge phones, collect water, and show gratitude to Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nGovt-and-politics AP North Korea's Kim boasts new ICBM as US flies bombers By HYUNG-JIN KIM - Associated Press Updated 32 min ago\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un says the test of a newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile confirmed that he has another \"reliable and maximum-capacity\" weapon to contain any outside threats. North Korea's state media said Saturday that Kim oversaw the launch of the Hwasong-17 missile a day after its neighbors said they had detected the flight of an ICBM with a potential to reach the continental U.S. Some experts say the Hwasong-17 missile is still under development but is the North's longest-range ballistic weapon designed to carry multiple nuclear warheads to defeat U.S. missile defense systems. The United States responded to the North's weapons launch by flying supersonic bombers in separate drills with South Korean and Japanese warplanes.\n\nNational News AP Jury says it's deadlocked in Danny Masterson rape trial AP Updated 32 min ago\n\nJurors at the Los Angeles rape trial of \"That '70s Show\" star Danny Masterson say they're deadlocked. But a judge has told them they have not deliberated long enough for her to declare a mistrial. After nearly three days of deliberations, the jurors emerged Friday afternoon and told Judge Charlaine Olmedo that they could not reach a unanimous verdict on any counts. She told them to resume deliberating on Nov. 28 after taking Thanksgiving week off. The 46-year-old Masterson is charged with the rape of three women in his Hollywood Hills home between 2001 and 2003. He has pleaded not guilty. The defense says the acts were consensual.\n\nNational News AP Elizabeth Holmes gets more than 11 years for Theranos scam By MICHAEL LIEDTKE - AP Technology Writer Updated 32 min ago\n\nDisgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes has been sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for duping investors in the failed startup that promised to revolutionize blood testing but instead made her a symbol of Silicon Valley ambition that veered into deceit. The sentence imposed Friday by U.S. District Judge Edward Davila was shorter than the 15-year penalty requested by federal prosecutors. But it was far tougher than the leniency her legal team sought for the mother of a year-old son with another child on the way.\n\n***\n\nMORNING LISTEN\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\n***\n\nIMAGE OF THE DAY\n\n***\n\nTODAY IN HISTORY Today in history: Nov. 19\n\nIn 1969, Apollo 12 astronauts Charles Conrad and Alan Bean made the second manned landing on the moon, and more events that happened on this d...\n\nToday in sports history: Nov. 19\n\nIn 1966, No. 1 Notre Dame and No. 2 Michigan State play to a 10-10 tie.\n\n***\n\nTODAY'S BIRTHDAYS Tags Dcc Wire Nation-world Dccjb Deal Birthday Celebrity History News Climate Breakthrough Wedding Today Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

Watch now.\n\nOver the last few weeks, many people have asked me the same question: Is the metaverse dead? This pessimism is not surprising, considering that Meta stock has lost over half its value since formally announcing its strategic pivot to the metaverse. Adding insult to injury, last week Meta announced major layoffs across the company, increasing fear throughout the industry.\n\nTrying my best to be objective, I see the current struggles at Meta as a reflection of its legacy business rather than an indication that its metaverse strategy is failing. I believe it will take another year or two before we can really predict whether Meta will be successful in this space, or if other large players will emerge as the true leaders of the metaverse.\n\nMy bigger concern is that the general public is still confused about what \"the metaverse\" is and how it will benefit society. You'd think this would be clear by now, but even simple definitions of the metaverse are hard to come by. Personally, I blame influencers from the Web3 space for creating the confusion, describing the metaverse in terms of blockchains, cryptocurrencies and NFTs. These are profoundly useful technologies but are no more relevant to the metaverse than 5G, GPS or GPUs.\n\nThe metaverse is not about any specific pieces of infrastructure.\n\nEvent\n\nIntelligent Security Summit\n\nLearn the critical role of AI & ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies on December 8.

          "body": "Yesterday's battle featured a seeded namesake versus an unseeded alleged tax cheat.\n\nDoug brought up an intriguing idea:\n\nOne of the pluses for Milne was his qualifying in multiple categories. You may have to give this one to Shakira given the lyrics to Hips Don't Lie, which has \"Shakira Shakira\" in the first verse. Though Dan brings up a good point about Mr. Beetlejuice, not to mention Keaton starring in the movie \"Multiplicity\", where he replicated himself. Reifying replication!\n\nUnfortunately this works for both candidates so it doesn't help us make the decistion.\n\nDespite personally being a huge Michael Keaton fan -- I'd definitely go to hear him speak! -- I had to go with the strongest argument, which came from Raghu:\n\nI don't really care about either of them, but as I am currently in a boring part of a Zoom meeting I visited Skakira's home page, which has a large button marked \"Discover Shakira's Perfumes.\" I did not click, but nonetheless it led me to think: (1) hopefully the finals of this matchup will be in person and not online, and (2) given that, I would rather discover Shakira's perfume than Michael Keaton's perfume.\n\nThis comment hit the spot, given our recent interest in non-visual graphical display. It also made me wonder: if you click on a perfume button during a zoom meeting and you aren't muted, will a pleasant smell waft out from the speakers of everyone else's computers?\n\nAnd Owen writes:\n\nI'd love to hear from the wild boar that stole Shakira's handbag; perhaps they could make a cameo alongside her?\n\nWe'll see how Shakira fares in the second round when she faces the juggernaut that is A. A. Milne.\n\nToday's matchup\n\nJames Naismith is second-seeded in the \"Creators of laws or rules\" category . . . I guess you've all heard of him. John Adams is the composer who shares the name of a famous revolutionary.\n\nIn preparation for this competition I went to the library and borrowed a record of music by John Adams, also got something by John Luther Adams, the composer whose claim to fame is that he shares a name with a more famous composer, who shares a name with, etc. Neither Adams's music appealed to my taste. But you can be a composer of dissonant, tuneless music and still be a good speaker, right? Or, to put it another way, give James Naismith a banjo or whatever and he might sound even worse. And Adams might have a killer two-handed set shot.",

But investors needn't fear them, because typically, when the market drops broadly, it also pulls down the prices of companies with solid long-term prospects. With the S&P 500 down by about 17% since the start of 2022, that's the case right now.\n\nTarget (NYSE: TGT) has dropped roughly 30% this year, nearly double the overall market. That includes a 13% decline on Nov. 16 after the company released quarterly results. Therefore, although the nervous investing climate has contributed to its pain, there are other factors investors interested in Target's stock must consider.\n\nWith Target's stock price down sharply, that makes this an opportune time to decide whether to buy shares.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nTarget dismayed investors in June when management warned it would have to mark down merchandise to clear the shelves, hurting its near-term margin and profit. Management announced that it expected the company's operating margin in the fiscal second quarter (which ended July 30) to come in around 2%, much lower than the 5.3% figure it had guided for the previous month.",

          "title": "LGHL Asks: Are Ohio State fans thinking more of Terps or TTUN? They also predict today's score",
          "body": "Every day for the entirety of the Ohio State football season, we will be asking and answering questions about the team, college football, and anything else on our collective minds of varying degrees of importance. If you have a question that you would like to ask, you can tweet us @LandGrant33 or if you need more than 280 characters, send an email HERE.\n\nThere's just one more game to go before The Game. That means that to keep their hopes alive for all of their preseason goals, the No. 2 Ohio State Buckeyes will need to take care of business this afternoon in College Park, Md. as they take on the sputtering Maryland Terrapins.\n\nHeading into today's contest, we wanted to check in with the Buckeye fan base to see your thoughts on today's game, the OSU season as a whole, and whether you might be looking a head a little. So, scroll down and see what you had on your minds.\n\nIn the words of Valerie, Miracle Max's wife in \"The Princess Bride,\" you are a \"Liar! Liar! Liaaaar!!!\" It is inconceivable to me that nearly half of all Buckeye fans that responded to this poll are thinking about both Maryland and that other M-school which will remain nameless for the next seven days.\n\nI suppose that could be on me, as I didn't really specify that you were thinking about them equally, so this could be a 90-10 type of situation, but still, no one is really thinking about Maryland, other than maybe thinking about how bad it would be if a majorly important Buckeye got hurt against the Terps.\n\nSo, you are welcome to say all of the right things in our little poll, but I'm going to venture to guess that you, like all normal Buckeye fans, are thinking far more about the Skunk Bears than the Turtles.\n\nThis one is tough for me because, objectively, I would say that C.J. Stroud, at least by virtue of his position, is the most valuable player on the team. While I'm sure that Kyle McCord would do a decent job stepping in for him if the Heisman front-runner were unavailable, Stroud is the best quarterback in the country, and that has to mean something.\n\nAs for Marvin Harrison Jr., I would agree if the question posed had been who has been the best player on the team this season, but it wasn't. I certainly think that Big Marv deserves to be in this conversation, but I don't know that I would have him first.\n\nSo, aside from positional bias being slanted toward the quarterback, I actually think that I might go with Tommy Eichenberg on this one. I know that he is not as flashy as some linebackers of Buckeye days gone by like Ryan Shazier, A.J. Hawk, Raekwon McMillan, James Laurinaitis, and more, but dude has been the backbone of a resurgent Ohio State defense this season. While not having Stroud or Harrison would obviously be a major loss, there are so many other talented players on offense -- and the unit has been so good for so long -- that I feel like their absences could be absorbed much more easily than not having arguably the best linebacker in the country captaining the defense.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think that everybody on this list deserves a poop-ton of praise for their efforts this season, but for me, because of how bad the defense (and the linebackers specifically) have been over the last few seasons, I'd go with Tommy as the MVP.\n\nIn our How to Watch article from this morning, I went on record predicting a 49-10 victory for Ohio State, so that would put me in the over 35 points category. I do believe that Day will try to get starters out earlier than normal this week if the score allows, simply to prevent putting players in opportunities to get hurt ahead of The Game next week.\n\nHowever, it's pretty clear that while Day has spoken about wanting to be collegial, especially against conference opponents, and not run up the score, that rule doesn't apply to Maryland. Ever since they were allegedly the snitches who tipped off the NCAA about Chase Young's girlfriend getting her flight to the 2018-season Rose Bowl paid for, leading to the Buckeye edge rusher being suspended, Ohio State has tried to give them their proverbial stitches at every possible turn.\n\nSo, while Stroud, Marv, Trey, Emeka, and Cade might not be the ones scoring, I do expect that Ohio State will look to keep putting points on the board as long as there is still time on the clock.\n\nWe didn't ask this question in our Buckeye Nation-specific poll this week, but rather our friends at SBN Reacts asked it in their nationwide poll, and while I think the results are a little closer than they should be, I am glad to see that the right guy is in the lead.\n\nThere has been a lot of love for North Carolina quarterback Drake Maye recently, and while I will be rooting for the Tar Heels to beat Clemson in the ACC Championship game, I'm still not on board. But, if Stroud can put up the expected numbers today and can then lead OSU to a win in The Game and the Big Ten Title Game, then there should be no reason to expect anybody other than the Buckeye signal-caller to take home the Heisman.",

The details of such agencies are being verified by aspirants with the support of the police.\n\nSince a majority of consultancy agencies charge huge advance and commission for their services, students and parents are worried about the security of the money deposited with the agencies. Moreover, the experience of a few duped students has doubled the aspirants' concerns.\n\n\"Though agencies like NoRKA Roots claim that they are making interventions to prevent fake offers, an easily accessible verification mechanism for aspirants is yet to be a reality. Most of them are forced to trust local agencies who are apparently good at canvasing clients with attractive offers,\" said Sneha Devassia, an anaesthetic technician who is waiting for her turn for higher studies and a part-time job abroad. \"What I do now is check with the police the history of agencies that I come in contact with,\" she added.\n\nFunctionaries of some State-level nursing associations said there were around 3,000 agencies across the State offering services. There is no clarity whether the agencies have operational licence or are controlled by government agencies, they added.\n\n\"There were incidents where some agencies cheated candidates after securing commission. There were also instances of agencies declining to offer the promised services after the departure of candidates for foreign countries,\" said a nurse from Kozhikode who recently migrated to the United Kingdom. She said many cheated aspirants and their families could not afford to resort to legal proceedings against such agencies.\n\nSince there are large number of vacancies for nurses in countries like the UK, the agencies back home are busy canvasing nurses with attractive offers on migration for higher studies and work. According to sources, some agencies are reportedly collecting huge sums as commission to complete paper work. There have also been instances of agencies offering to fabricate experience certificates of candidates to match the requirements of overseas recruiters, they said.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour department officials said efforts were on to introduce a stronger licensing system and monitoring mechanism. Discussions are in progress to finalise a concrete action plan in consultation with the Ministry of Law and Finance, they clarified.",

          "body": "Texas Governor Greg Abbott is deploying National Guard troops in M113 armored personnel carrier to various positions along the border after earlier threatening to use gunboats in an attempt to quell the influx of migrants at the border.\n\nLoad Error\n\nThe news comes after Abbott invoked a Constitutional clause on Wednesday warning President Joe Biden that the Lone Star state would go rogue to defend itself from what he calls a migrant 'invasion' at the southern border.\n\nTexas Military Department officials ordered the 10 armored personnel carriers on Thursday and announced around 50 soldiers would be trained to operate them.\n\nArmored personnel carriers are large, heavily armored vehicles that move on tracks like tanks but are designed to carry troops into battle alongside tanks.\n\nAffectionately known as the 'battle taxi' by troops in the Army, the M113 is bulletproof and can withstand small explosions - the US recently sent 200 to Ukraine for the country's fight against Russia.\n\nIt remains unclear if the armored personnel carriers sent to the border will have any weaponry attached, but the vehicle can equip heavy machine guns and grenade launchers.\n\n'These actions are part of a larger strategy to use every available tool to fight back against the record-breaking level of illegal immigration,' said a statement from the Texas Military Department.\n\nIn addition to the armored personnel carriers, the department announced increased 'aircraft flights and security efforts' as the state takes 'unprecedented measures to safeguard our border.'\n\nOn Wednesday, Abbott made it clear to President Biden that Texas is taking the border crisis seriously, telling him that 'Texans are paying the price for your failure' at the border and the Democrat's policies have led to 'catastrophic consequences.'\n\n© Provided by Daily Mail Abbott announced his intent to invoke the clause on Tuesday, along with a list of controversial enforcement proposals\n\n'Your silence in the face of our repeated pleas is deafening. Your refusal to even visit the border for a firsthand look at the chaos you have caused is damning,' the searing note went on.\n\n'Two years of inaction on your part now leave Texas with no choice but to escalate our efforts to secure our State.'\n\nAbbott also told Biden the founders who crafted the Constitution and that particular invasion clause 'foresaw your failures.'\n\nThe constitutional clause Abbott is invoking to ramp up the resources at the border is found in Article I Section 10 of the Constitution, and forbids individual states from unilateral military action 'unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.'\n\nA record surge in asylum-seekers attempting to cross into the US through Mexico under the last two years of Biden's term has strained the US federal immigration system.\n\nBefore he sent the letter to Biden, Abbott took to Twitter to inform his followers he 'invoked the Invasion Clauses of the U.S. & Texas Constitutions to fully authorize Texas to take unprecedented measures to defend our state against an invasion.'\n\nHe also wants to 'build a wall in multiple counties on the border,' 'deploy gun boats to secure the border,' and designate Mexican-based drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations - something that only the federal government can do.\n\nAbbott also called for entering security 'compacts' with other states and 'enter into agreements with foreign powers to enhance border security.'\n\nThe post mirrors a separate letter Abbott sent to county judges along the Texas-Mexico border on Monday in which he vowed to take executive action and invoke the clause.\n\n'Texas has devoted more than $4 billion of Texas taxpayer dollars toward these and other efforts to secure the border and enhance public safety,' the letter stated of the collective initiatives.\n\nLast month there were 230,678 recorded encounters between undocumented migrants and Border Patrol officers, the most recent data show. That's a slight increase from September.\n\nThe list includes deploying the National Guard and Texas Department of Public Safety to arrest migrants and send them back across the border - it's not clear if asylum-seekers are included.\n\n© Provided by Daily Mail\n\nHe also wants to 'build a wall in multiple counties on the border,' 'deploy gun boats to secure the border,' and designate Mexican-based drug cartels as foreign terrorists.\n\nMore than 2.3 million migrants were arrested along the southern border last fiscal year, the highest recorded number in US history.\n\nMore than 1.6 million were adults, 560,600 were families and 152,000 were unaccompanied minors - an all-time high for that group.\n\nAbbott has also ramped up pressure on Democratic politicians to get serious about the border crisis by sending busloads of immigrants to 'sanctuary cities' across the US, most recently to Philadelphia.\n\nTexas has transported more than 13,000 migrants to those cities since April, with Abbott decrying the repeal of Trump-era Title 42 legislation that allowed border officials to immediately expel asylum-seekers due to COVID-19.\n\n'This will further signal to cartels, human smugglers, & illegal immigrants that the border is wide open - inciting more violence & lawlessness,' he said.\n\nFederal officers made more than 230,600 arrests in October at the U.S.-Mexico border, and expelled more than 78,400 without providing a chance for them to plead their cases.\n\nRead more Continue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

          "body": "House GOP pushes Hunter Biden probe despite thin majority\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Even with their threadbare House majority, Republicans doubled down this week on using their new power to investigate the Biden administration and in particular the president's son. But their midterms miss has emboldened a White House that has long prepared for this moment. Republicans secured much smaller margins than anticipated, with Biden aides and Democrats feeling like voters punished the GOP for reliance on conspiracy theories and Donald Trump-fueled lies over the 2020 election. Democrats outside the White House have mobilized to combat what they anticipate will be a steady stream of misinformation from the House.\n\nUN climate talks poised for deal creating disaster fund\n\nSHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP) -- Negotiators say they have struck a potential breakthrough deal on the thorniest issue of United Nations climate talks, creation of a fund for compensating poor nations that are victims of extreme weather worsened by rich nations' carbon pollution. \"There is an agreement on loss and damage,\" which is what negotiators call the concept, Maldives Environment Minister Aminath Shauna told The Associated Press Saturday. It still needs to be approved unanimously in a vote later today.\n\nDangerous lake-effect snow wallops northern New York state\n\nBUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Residents of northern New York state are digging out from a dangerous lake-effect snowstorm that had dropped nearly 6 feet of snow in some areas and caused three deaths. The Buffalo metro area was hit hard, with some areas south of the city receiving more than 5 feet by early Saturday. The inundation forced the NFL to move Sunday's game between the Buffalo Bills and Cleveland Browns to Detroit from the Bills' home stadium in Orchard Park. The National Weather Service is forecasting snow showers through Sunday evening before mixing with rain on Monday.\n\nBiden at 80: A 'respecter of fate' mulls 2nd White House bid\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The oldest president in U.S. history is hitting a milestone birthday. Biden turns 80 on Sunday, and questions are swirling about whether he has the acuity and stamina to run for president again, if he chooses to do so. He says he intends to run, yet leaves himself an out, saying he is \"a great respecter of fate.\" He's got a record as a campaign winner and has posted major legislative successes in recent months. But surveys of voters point to concern about his capabilities. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision, at age 82, to pull back from leadership and let a new generation rise may spill over into Biden's thinking\n\n'We survived': Kherson comes alive after Russian withdrawal\n\nKHERSON, Ukraine (AP) -- Residents of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson can't escape reminders of the terrifying eight months they spent under Russian occupation: missing people, mines everywhere, a scarcity of electricity and water, and explosions day and night as Russian and Ukrainian forces keep battling. Yet despite these hardships, Kherson residents are expressing a mix of relief, optimism, and even joy -- not least because of the freedom they regained a week ago to express themselves at all. People are no longer afraid to leave home, or worried that contact with occupying Russian forces might lead to a prison or torture cell. They are gathering in city squares to recharge phones, collect water, and show gratitude to Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nIn Pelosi, women admire a leader with calm, cool confidence\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to step down from Democratic leadership after 20 years has many women admiring the way she wielded power. They watched her wrangle an unruly Congress or stare down a bombastic president without losing her cool. Kelly Haggerty, an engineer for the city of Syracuse, New York, has a photo of Pelosi confronting former President Donald Trump taped to her refrigerator. She hopes it will remind her two teenage daughters to \"stand up and say what you have to say.\" Rep. Karen Bass, the incoming mayor of Los Angeles, says Pelosi embraced her power without being \"heavy-handed about it.\"\n\nInfantino scolds World Cup critics in extraordinary diatribe\n\nDOHA, Qatar (AP) -- FIFA president Gianni Infantino has delivered a one-hour tirade on the eve of the World Cup's opening match and then spent about 45 minutes answering questions from media about the Qatari government's actions and a wide range of other topics. Infantino says he feels gay, feels like a woman and feels like a migrant worker. Infantino later defended the country's immigration policy and praised the government for bringing in migrants to work. He called Europe's criticism of Qatar's policy on migrant workers \"hypocrisy.\" He says \"give them some future. Give them some hope.\"\n\nNorth Korea's Kim boasts new ICBM as US flies bombers\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un says the test of a newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile confirmed that he has another \"reliable and maximum-capacity\" weapon to contain any outside threats. North Korea's state media said Saturday that Kim oversaw the launch of the Hwasong-17 missile a day after its neighbors said they had detected the flight of an ICBM with a potential to reach the continental U.S. Some experts say the Hwasong-17 missile is still under development but is the North's longest-range ballistic weapon designed to carry multiple nuclear warheads to defeat U.S. missile defense systems. The United States responded to the North's weapons launch by flying supersonic bombers in separate drills with South Korean and Japanese warplanes.\n\nOhio's Intel project triggers housing fears in tight market\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Intel's announcement of a $20 billion manufacturing operation bringing thousands of jobs to central Ohio has been greeted as an economic boon. But it's also raised concerns about the impact on a region already suffering a housing shortage. Melissa Humbert-Washington is vice president of programs and services at Homes for Families, an agency that helps low-wage workers find housing. She says the project has housing advocates wondering where everyone will live. The project is expected to attract 10,000 or more workers in the next few years. The Building Industry Association of Central Ohio says the region needs about 19,000 new multi-family and single-family housing units a year, but is only averaging about 8,200 annually.\n\nPope visits immigrant father's hometown for birthday party\n\nPORTACOMARO, Itatly (AP) -- Pope Francis has returned to his father's birthplace in northern Italy for the first time since ascending the papacy. He's going to celebrate the 90th birthday of a second cousin who long knew him as simply \"Giorgio.\" The visit touches on keystones of Francis' papacy, including the importance of honoring the elderly and the human toll of migration. Francis' private visit Saturday will be followed by public one Sunday to celebrate Mass for the local faithful, where he could well reflect on his family's own experience migrating to Argentina. The pope's father was born in the small agricultural town of Portacomaro, 10 kilometers (six miles) east of Asti.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Apmediaapi Summarybrief General News Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

          "body": "New Delhi [India], November 19 (ANI): With an aim to develop a regulatory framework and alternative technology adoption roadmap for Green Shipping to foster carbon neutrality and circular economy (CE) in the shipping sector in India, Union Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways and Ayush, Sarbananda Sonowal on Saturday announced India's first National Centre of Excellence for Green PortShipping (NCoEGPS) a major initiative by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping towards providing greener solutions.\n\nThe announcement was made by the Union Minister at the recently concluded \"INMARCO 2022\" in Mumbai.\n\n\"India intends to increase the share of renewable energy to 60 per cent of the total power demand of each of its major ports from a present share of less than 10 per cent. This will be through solar and wind-generated power,\" read an official statement.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Union Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said, \"It is my immense pleasure to announce the establishment of India's first centre of excellence for Green Port and Shipping as a major attempt by the Ministry towards realising Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji's Mission LiFE movement. As per the vision of PM Modi Ji, this movement is going to be an India-led global movement for collective action to protectpreserve Enviornment.\"Adding that the new centre is an important step towards this movement as it aims to transform ports and shipping turn more Enviornment friendly, he said, \"The Deendayal Port Authority Kandla, Paradip Port Authority, Paradip, V.O Chidambaranar Port Authority, Thoothukudi and Cochin Shipyard Limited, Kochi have all extended their support to the ministry to set up this centre. The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) is the knowledge and implementation partner for this project.\"\"This Centre will help on policy and regulatory support to the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways for developing regulatory framework and alternate technology adoption roadmap for Green Shipping to foster carbon neutrality and circular economy (CE) in shipping sector in India. I thank all the stakeholders of this project for hedging their resources towards a very important aspect of the sector,\" he added.\n\nThe ports have also aimed to reduce Carbon emissions per ton of cargo handled by 30% by 2030. The Maritime Vision Document 2030, released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a 10 Year blueprint on India's vision of a sustainable Maritime sector and vibrant blue economy. India has been selected as the first country under the IMO Green Voyage 2050 project to conduct a pilot project related to Green Shipping.\n\nIndia will also be implementing IMO energy efficiency requirements for existing ships and carbon intensity requirements on all its vessels whether coastal or international in order to help achieve IMO GHG reduction targets. India is already supplying shore power to ships with a power demand of less than 150 KW at present and targeting to supply shore power to all visiting ships. India is working actively at Marine EnvironmentalProtection Committee of IMO to help devise acceptable regulatory requirements for GHG emission reduction in line with IMO GHG initial strategy.\n\n\"India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) under the Paris Agreement for the Period 2021-2030 include: to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 from 2005 level, and to achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and low-cost international finance,\" added the statement.\n\nThe Ministry also informed that India is well on its way to achieve these targets and has already achieved more than 24.5 per cent share of Renewable Energy (RE) in total Installed Capacity. Globally, today India stands 4th in RE power capacity, 4th in Wind power, and 5th in Solar Power capacity. As all the industry sectors are moving towards achieving carbon neutrality and implementing CE measures ahead of Government of India commitment for the year 2070.\n\n\"The shipping sector which is both energy and resource intensive also needs an implementation road map to achieve energy and resource neutrality. Therefore, the work undertaken by the NCoEGPS will provide the decision makers at a national and sub-national level with methodology and framework to implement carbon neutrality measures, to meet (and exceed) obligations under the Paris Accord through electrification of process, through renewable energy, carbon capture and storage, and other emerging alternate fuel technologies including green fuels,\" added the statement.\n\nThe scope of work carried out by NCoEGPS will also include training and capacity of different stakeholders for fast-tracking adoption green measures identified through research, informed officials.\n\n\"The NCoEGPS will be working under the framework of the Sagarmala programme of the MoPSW. The main objective of the proposed NCoEGPS is to provide support to MoPSW in developing and maintaining a policy and regulatory framework for a green alternative technologies roadmap for the shipping sector in India for its transition to carbon neutrality and CE principles,\" added the statement.

In the training set, the C statistic of the final multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was 0.86 for men and 0.85 for women versus 0.85 for men and 0.87 for women in the testing data set. Some modifiable risk and protective factors were similar between men and women, but they also presented independent risk factors that accounted for 31.7 percent of men developing dementia and 53.35 percent of women developing dementia, according to the weighted population-attributable fraction. The total point score of the risk score model ranged from -18 to 30 in men versus -17 to 30 in women. For both genders, the risk score model yielded nearly 100 percent prediction accuracy of 13-year dementia risk.\n\n\"The findings of this diagnostic study suggest that a risk score tool can be used for individual prediction of dementia risk that may help individuals to identify their potential risk profile and provide guidance on precise and timely actions to take to prevent or delay dementia,\" the authors write.\n\nAbstract/Full Text",

          "title": "On my radar: Jordan Gray's cultural highlights",
          "body": "The comedian on her favourite thing on TV, Alan Partridge's adventures in podcasting, and getting into the Christmas spirit on London's South Bank\n\nThe comedian Jordan Gray was born in Thurrock, Essex, in 1989. She started out as a singer, recording under the name Tall Dark Friend, and was a semi-finalist on The Voice in 2016 - the UK talent show's first transgender contestant. She switched to comedy the following year and this August was nominated for an Edinburgh comedy award for her acclaimed show Is It a Bird?, which transfers to the Soho theatre from 13 to 23 December. She is the host of the podcast Transplaining and is developing her 2020 web series Transaction into a sitcom of the same name for ITV.\n\nHacks (series two)\n\nThis is probably my favourite thing on TV at the moment. Jean Smart plays a Las Vegas comedian called Deborah Vance, whose act is getting tired, so she teams up with Hannah Einbinder's character Eva Daniels, a young, entitled comedy writer. The show explores this strange, dark mentorship. In series two, they're on the road as Deborah takes her new show around the country. It's rare to see standup portrayed properly in scripted formats on film or TV, but Hacks does it really well. It's very rich and very funny.\n\nLord Huron\n\nI came across Lord Huron when one of their songs played in the finale of the US sitcom Community, my favourite show of all time. They're an LA-based band who make cinematic music with a country, skiffly twist. It's sweet and sultry with gorgeous male harmonies. If you're feeling a bit down, it's the kind of music that respects your emotional state but will introduce a sort of whimsy that might help you on your journey. The Night We Met is my favourite of their songs.\n\nDon't Worry Darling\n\nMy wife wanted to see a film with Harry Styles in it - she's a fan - and I went along expecting a romantic comedy. Which it has pinches of, but then it takes a dystopian sci-fi twist. It's set in a 50s-style utopian community in the Californian desert. Florence Pugh plays a wife whose idyllic life takes a hallucinatory turn. It's paced very well, it looks gorgeous and it speaks to the society we're living in. I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nSouth Bank Christmas market, London\n\nI'm really looking forward to a bit of kitsch, twinkly fun this Christmas, so my wife and I are planning to go to the South Bank Christmas market. I haven't been before, but I'm picturing mulled wine huts and lots of gaudy trinkets that will end up in a drawer for the rest of the year. My wife, who's from the Czech Republic, is a big fan of Christmas. She really enjoys our little customs and traditions, so I'm trying to sell her the idea of a quintessential British Christmas without too much of the fanfare.\n\nDishoom, King's Cross, London N1\n\nMy agent took me for a celebratory meal at [the Indian restaurant chain] Dishoom after the Edinburgh fringe. I really enjoyed it, though I did wonder if the experience was rose-tinted. Then we had an impromptu breakfast at the King's Cross branch the other day with Richard Herring, and it definitely holds up. I had the egg naan breakfast wrap - the best combination of things you can imagine. Richard spent the first 15 minutes talking about how he wasn't going to be eating carbs, but that went out the window.\n\nFrom the Oasthouse: The Alan Partridge Podcast, series two (Audible)\n\nAfter years of being a radio and TV host, Alan Partridge has dived into podcasting, though he's not entirely familiar with the conventions. There's a lot of jeopardy in series two. He nearly drowns and gets trapped underground. He hasn't quite figured out the genre, so in one episode he decides it's a true-crime podcast because his house may have been broken into; in another, it's a dating podcast. It's wonderfully done.",

Russian journalist Mikhail Zygar told CNN that \"no decision can, or has, been made without\" Putin during the invasion of Ukraine but that the Russian autocratic appears desperate to avoid taking responsibility for the battlefield losses and retreats. Mr Zygar claimed Putin was trying to blame his defence minister Sergei Shoigu and his newly-appointed leader of the war effort General Sergei Surovikin, hence why it was those two that publicly announced the retreat from Kherson.",

          "body": "Check out the on-demand sessions from the Low-Code/No-Code Summit to learn how to successfully innovate and achieve efficiency by upskilling and scaling citizen developers. Watch now.\n\nSince DALL-E's release to public beta last month, several companies have begun incorporating its use for various cases across the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape. Tome, a storytelling and ideation platform, announced this week that its interactive slide functionality is now supported by DALL-E technology. Users can apply DALL-E to assist them with presentation visuals to precisely convey what they envision. Tome says it's also working with GPT-3 to add more generative AI functionality to its platform in the near future.\n\nAlso on the generative AI spectrum, Microsoft this week unveiled that its Project Bonsai reinforcement learning will be supported by d-Matrix DIMC technology. The aim is to speed up AI inference. For context, generative AI's use of transformer models is imperative to its functionality, but is also a resource intensive process. Inference systems in AI assist with predicting and building results from a model. Microsoft's move to accelerate the process will help increase efficiency and deployment of generative AI models.\n\nNvidia also made strides this week with the announcement of advancements aimed at improving its Omniverse, extending scientific applications on top of high-performance computing systems. The company said this will allow digital twins to bring together the data that currently sits siloed across various apps, models and user experiences. Lead product manager of accelerated computing, Dion Harris, said it's a step toward evolving digital twins from passively modeling to actively shaping the world.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel's news this week focused on shaping the world in a different way: Eliminating deepfakes. The company introduced a new tool dubbed the FakeCatcher, which it claims has a 96% accuracy rate and works by a ...",

          "title": "All Hands on Deck as TSA and CBP Prepare for Busy Holiday Travel Period - HS Today",
          "body": "Former Federal Security Director at Los Angeles International Airport and now Vice President of K2 Security Screening Group, Keith Jeffries, told Homeland Security Today that TSA plans months in advance for holiday and peak season travel. \"It's an all-hands-on deck approach,\" Keith said.\n\nNational and international travel could reach pre-pandemic levels this holiday season, making preparation even more important.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has seen an increase in travel throughout this year and anticipates airport security checkpoints nationwide will be very busy this holiday travel season. The season kicks off with Thanksgiving travel, which begins Friday, Nov. 18 and concludes Sunday, Nov. 27.\n\n\"We expect to be busier this year than last year at this time, and probably very close to pre-pandemic levels,\" said TSA Administrator David Pekoske. \"We are prepared to handle the projected increase in travel volumes next week. However, going forward, making the TSA pay levels equal to other federal agencies is critical to our ability in 2023 to recruit, train, equip and retain a highly skilled and professional workforce on the frontlines of transportation security. It is up to Congress to act on the President's budget request without delay, enabling TSA to address the current pay gap, which is up to 30% compared with other federal employees.\"\n\nTravel volumes this year have been notably higher leading up to holiday weekends, and this Thanksgiving travel period, TSA says travel volumes may reach pre-pandemic levels. The three busiest days during the Thanksgiving travel period are typically Tuesday and Wednesday prior to Thanksgiving and Sunday after the holiday. TSA could screen as many as 2.5 million passengers at checkpoints nationwide on Wednesday, Nov. 23, and may surpass 2.5 million passengers on Sunday, Nov. 27.\n\nTSA recorded the heaviest passenger screening volume in its history on the Sunday following Thanksgiving in 2019, where Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) screened nearly 2.9 million passengers at checkpoints nationwide. On that same day in 2021, TSOs screened nearly 2.5 million passengers nationwide.\n\nThanksgiving is a great warm up to what the Christmas and New Years holiday travel season will be. There is about a two week lull between Thanksgiving and Christmas where a slight decrease in volume may occur.\n\nFormer Federal Security Director at Los Angeles International Airport and now Vice President of K2 Security Screening Group, Keith Jeffries, told Homeland Security Today that TSA plans months in advance for holiday and peak season travel. Airline partners are in daily contact and will provide both forecasted flight and passenger load information to local TSA units to help shape those plans. \"It's an all-hands-on deck approach,\" Keith said. \"Overtime sign-up opportunities are at a premium with federal holiday pay at double time. There is maximum use of the K9 teams, Inspectors and even the TSA Human Resource Staff will assist at the checkpoints by moving trays and giving advice to passengers on how to properly divest their personal items as they approach the security checkpoint.\n\n\"TSA understands that passengers are trying to get home to their loved ones for the holidays, and the airport, airline and TSA Public Affairs team will coordinate with media outlets to ensure they have the most current advisements to help inform the public.\"\n\nAirline, airport, and law enforcement partners usually offer staff and assistance during the holiday or peak season as well. \"Having law enforcement officers visible in a busy security checkpoint can have an amazing calming effect on the passengers,\" Keith said. \"Holiday travel is a partnership that takes everyone - TSA, airline, airport, law enforcement, and concessionaire employees - all working together.\" Passengers have a big role to play too. \"The most important thing for passengers to know is to pack your patience and give yourself plenty of time (two hours or more) to get through security to make it to your flight,\" Keith advised.\n\nContingency plans are also put in place to react to potential equipment problems, like the failure of x-ray machines at a security checkpoint. \"Local TSA will have coordinated well in advance with the local equipment maintenance team for both staff availability and extra parts for security equipment,\" Keith told us. \"Worst case scenario is that it may take a day or two to get equipment repaired but advance planning usually means this can happen much faster\".\n\nBoth TSA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have published top tips to help holiday travel go smoothly as well as a guide to traveling with holiday food and drink. CBP will host a Facebook Live event Monday at 2 p.m. to help make the travel experience easier. During the event, a panel of experts from CBP's Office of Field Operations will provide live responses to CBP-related travel questions. Subjects will include travel tips on documents, biometrics, mobile applications, and advice on avoiding counterfeits.\n\nAnd for those feeling bad about the officers working through the holidays, Keith told us that camaraderie and holiday spirit are in abundance at airport checkpoints. \"Customer compliments for TSOs usually spike during the holidays as most everyone seems to be in a better mood traveling and working as well.\" So if a TSO helps make your holiday happy, be sure to let them know!",

Media is very important to distribute tolerance messages, Mohammed Jalal Al Rayssi, Director General of the Emirates News Agency (WAM) told Kabar.\n\nIn an interview, held on the sidelines of the Global Media Congress in Abu Dhabi on Thursday, speaking about the future of the media industry Mohammed Jalal Al Rayssi noted the importance of such platform as the Global Media Congress.\n\n\"I think today on the last day of the Global Media Congress we can see how its important to build a place that we can talk together and build a network together and try to not only think about the future, but also think about how we can have a connection with the world. So that's a very important thing.\n\nAnd other thing is that we are trying to come together with the new initiatives that can fit in the future of the media.\n\nWe are happy that we are having people from around the world here talking about their experiences, sharing the information that we have with others, sharing their concern, coming up with a new idea, having the chance also for young generation to be trained, to give them the opportunity to be ready for the future. So it's a multi things that we have and this is that leading us that the UAE can play a good role to bring people together to give them also the opportunity for the future of the media and their places and also can give them a clear vision for the future of the media,\" Mohammed Jalal Al Rayssi said.\n\nSpeaking about the tolerance and coexistence, the director general of WAM highlighted the role of media in distributing tolerance messages.\n\n\"I think that one of the important things that we have to think every time as a media that we have to go back to our human natural, which is we all are human and we have differences and we have common things, why we always focus on differences why we don't focus on other things that we have, common things that we have. So, tolerance is important and coexistence is important for us all in the media because when you have words in the media creating such a hate between people, between countries or nationalities , between colours that can stay with the people and create a lot of problems a lot of also crimes, a lot of hates between people and others, so the media is very important to distribute tolerance messages and news and also showcase not only problems, wars, crisis, show also the tolerance story and nice story between people who are living , human stories, success stories, positive stories. That will create a different kind of human. When we will get up in the morning and saw bad news you might all day will be in bad mood sometimes, how about if we have a good news every day that will change our mood that will give us positive energy for war for anything,\" Director General of the Emirates News Agency Mohammed Jalal Al Rayssi said.",

I consider you, along with Kim Woodburn and Monty Don, to be a gay icon.\n\n'You were the first premiership footballer to do shoots with gay magazines like Attitude, to speak openly about your gay fans, and you married a Spice Girl which is the gayest thing a human being can do.\n\n'But now it's 2022 and you've signed a reported £10million deal with Qatar to be their ambassador during the Fifa World Cup. Qatar was voted as one of the worst places in the world to be gay - homosexuality is illegal, punishable by imprisonment, and if you're Muslim, possibly even death.'\n\nHe continued: 'You have always talked about the power of football as a force for good, which suggests to me you have never seen West Brom. But generally, I agree - so with that in mind, I'm giving you a choice.\n\n'If you end your relationship with Qatar, I will donate ten grand of my own money (that's a grand for every million you're reportedly getting) to charities that support queer people in football.\n\n'However, if you do not, I will throw the money into a shredder at midday next Sunday, just before the opening ceremony of the World Cup and stream it right here. Not just the money, but also your status as gay icon will be shredded.\n\n'Also, you'll be forcing me to commit what might be a crime. Although even then, I reckon I'll get off more lightly than I would if I got caught whacking off a lad in Doha. The choice is yours.

          "title": "Alabama fails to complete lethal injection for 3rd time",
          "body": "By KIM CHANDLER and JAY REEVES - Associated Press\n\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama's string of troubled lethal injections, which worsened late Thursday as prison workers aborted another execution because of a problem with intravenous lines, is unprecedented nationally, a group that tracks capital punishment said Friday.\n\nThe uncompleted execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith was the state's second such instance of being unable to kill an inmate in the past two months and its third since 2018. The state completed an execution in July, but only after a three-hour delay caused at least partly by the same problem with starting an IV line.\n\nA leader at the Death Penalty Information Center, an anti-death penalty group with a large database on executions, said no state other than Alabama has had to halt an execution in progress since 2017, when Ohio halted Alva Campbell's lethal injection because workers couldn't find a vein.\n\nPeople are also reading...

In a statement, it blamed the late-running court action for the cancellation because prison officials \"had a short timeframe to complete its protocol.\"\n\nPrison officials said they called off Smith's execution for the night after they were unable to get the lethal injection underway within the 100-minute window between the courts clearing the way for it to begin and a midnight deadline when the death warrant expired for the day. The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for Smith's execution when at about 10:20 p.m. it lifted a stay issued earlier in the evening by the 11th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals. But the state decided about an hour later that the lethal injection would not happen that evening.\n\n\"We have no concerns about the state's ability to carry out future lethal injection procedures,\" the Alabama Department of Corrections said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"The department will continue to review its processes, as it routinely does following each execution, to identify areas of improvement.\" Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey also blamed Smith's last-minute appeals as the reason \"justice could not be carried out\"\n\nU.S District Judge R. Austin Huffaker Jr. on Friday granted a request from Smith's lawyers to visit with Smith and take photographs of his body. He also ordered the state to preserve notes and other materials related to what happened in the failed execution. Smith's attorneys said they believe he may have been strapped to a gurney for four hours even though his final appeals were still underway.\n\n\"Mr. Smith no doubt has injuries from the attempted execution -- and certainly physical and testimonial evidence that needs to be preserved -- that can and should be photographed and/or filmed,\" lawyers for Smith wrote.\n\nSmith, who was scheduled to be put to death for the murder-for-hire slaying of a preacher's wife in 1988, was returned to death row at Holman Prison after surviving the attempt, a prison official said. His lawyers declined to comment Friday morning.\n\nCorrections Commissioner John Hamm said prison staff tried for about an hour to get the two required intravenous lines connected to Smith, 57. Hamm said they established one line but were unsuccessful with a second line, which is required under the state's protocol as a backup, after trying several locations on Smith's body.\n\nOfficials then tried a central line, which involves a catheter placed into a large vein. \"We were not able to have time to complete that, so we called off the execution,\" Hamm said.\n\nThe initial postponement came after Smith's final appeals focused on problems with IV lines at Alabama's last two scheduled lethal injections. Because the death warrant expired at midnight, the state must go back to court to seek a new execution date.\n\nAdvocacy groups and defense lawyers said Alabama's continued problems show a need for a moratorium to investigate how the death penalty is carried out in the state.\n\n\"Once again, the state of Alabama has shown that it is not capable of carrying out the present execution protocol without torture,\" federal defender John Palombi, who has represented many death row inmates in the state, said via email\n\nProsecutors said Smith was one of two men who were each paid $1,000 to kill Elizabeth Sennett on behalf of her husband, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect the insurance. The slaying -- and the revelations of who was behind it -- rocked the small north Alabama community where it happened in Colbert County and inspired a song called \"The Fireplace Poker,\" by the Southern rock group Drive-By Truckers.\n\nJohn Forrest Parker, the other man convicted in the slaying, was executed in 2010.\n\nAlabama has faced scrutiny over its problems at recent lethal injections. In ongoing litigation, lawyers for inmates are seeking information about the qualifications of the execution team members responsible for connecting the lines. In a Thursday hearing in Smith's case, a federal judge asked the state how long was too long to try to establish a line, noting at least one state gives an hour limit.\n\nThe execution of Joe Nathan James Jr. in July took several hours to get underway because of problems establishing an IV line, leading Reprieve US Forensic Justice Initiative, an anti-death penalty group, to claim the execution was botched.\n\nIn September the state called off the scheduled execution of Alan Miller because of difficulty accessing his veins. Miller said in a court filing that prison staff poked him with needles for more than an hour, and at one point left him hanging vertically on a gurney before announcing they were stopping. Prison officials have maintained the delays were the result of the state carefully following procedures.\n\nAlabama in 2018 called off the execution of Doyle Hamm because of problems getting the intravenous line connected. Hamm had damaged veins because of lymphoma, hepatitis and past drug use, his lawyer said. Hamm later died in prison of natural causes.\n\nReeves reported from Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nMore of AP's coverage of executions can be found at https://apnews.com/hub/executions\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

          "body": "The high cost and maintenance of incinerators make them unaffordable, hence, many people throw away diapers and napkins along with plastic waste or burn them unscientifically\n\nThe Kozhikode Corporation is planning to rope in an agency to handle waste, including used diapers and sanitary napkins, as part of its hygiene policy. Health Standing Committee chairperson S. Jayasree said expression of interest (EoI) had been sought from two agencies working in the sector, and that one of them shall be finalised soon.\n\nProcessing of diapers and sanitary napkins has been a challenge to the civic body even as it has deployed Haritha Karma Sena (HKS) members in most wards for collection of non-biodegradable waste. Diapers, though plastic, shall not be recycled like other plastic waste such as carry bags or bottles.\n\nThe only scientifically approved method to dispose of diapers and sanitary napkins is to burn them at very high temperature in an incinerator. The high cost and maintenance of incinerators make them unaffordable for small establishments, and, as a result, most people throw away used diapers and sanitary napkins along with plastic waste or burn them unscientifically.\n\nThere were complaints that sanitary products were found in waste bins in the city forcing HKS members or cleaning workers of the Corporation to handle them. The Corporation's plan to set up incinerators was abandoned owing to difficulty in getting clearance from the State Pollution Control Board (PCB).\n\n\"We found that setting up incinerators is not a viable option as it is difficult to maintain them, not to mention its high cost. A slight carelessness could render them useless. Hence, we are trying to rope in either Kerala Enviro Infrastructure Ltd. [KEIL] or Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-friendly [IMAGE] to handle sanitary waste. Details, including collection method, are yet to be worked out,\" Ms. Jayasree said.",

          "title": "Ed Washington releases sophomore album \"Hedonism\"",
          "body": "A year ago, Ed Washington released his debut album, \"Stoicism.\" Loosely based on a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium of the same name, \"Stoicism\" examined the importance of personal virtue ethics and the singer's relationship to the world around him.\n\n\"[The album] was a way of documenting my trial and error, and just trying to understand myself and understand the world. There was a moment in my life when I really felt I needed to be stoic and adhere to those ideologies. Later, I was definitely hedonistic for a part of my life as well. The final project is going to be about a theory on the good life, based on the Greek concept of Eudaimonia. And that's going to be the hardest one to write because I think it needs to be the most thought out,\" explained Washington.\n\nHis sophomoric album, \"Hedonism,\" was released on October 28 of this year and veers slightly away from the idealistic nature of Washington's debut.\n\n\"I think 'Hedonism' focuses on where I went after my heartbreak. I went down a dark path of just trying to fill a void with empty pleasures, and realizing that true happiness is more about the things that take work and are more substantial, and not just empty,\" said Washington.\n\nNever one to avoid tackling some of the most difficult topics - addiction, sex, and mental health - Washington's album is infused with the same insightful, sometimes playful lyricism that has garnered the artist local acclaim.\n\n\"This new album has a theme of running from pain and hiding from pain, trying to find pleasure in relationships, drugs, sex, and things like that. It's a journey people go through as young adults, mostly. There were a lot of good times, but there's still a lot of unhealed trauma that I needed to cope with,\" said Washington.\n\nThematically, Washington's music has aligned with other heart-driven singer-songwriters like Nick Carpenter and Quinn Christopherson, with whom he frequently collaborates. Naturally, Washington's delightfully cathartic music is inspired by the unique upbringing Alaskans experience. To fully understand Washington's point of view, look no further than the track \"Everything's Okay.\"\n\n\"'Everything's Okay' represents my realization that everything isn't okay. I still have a lot of issues to deal with from my childhood, from relationships that went wrong. Whether it be friendships or romance, I just held on to everything for a really long time. And so this album has been a chance for me to release all of that pain,\" said Washington.\n\nRecently nominated for Best Male Vocalist, Best Singer, Best Songwriter, Best Hip Hop Artist, Best R&B Artist, and Best Band for the 2022 Press Picks, it appears that Washington's message is felt deeply by the Anchorage community.\n\n\"Those nominations mean a lot. I was born and raised here. I went to college here, where I studied music. I played in supportive roles in bands like Medium Build, where I was a bass and keyboard player. I've always been nurtured by this community, that's how I learned to do what I do. Recognition always feels really nice, and it feels good to be seen. And I think that's what a lot of artists want. I'm very grateful,\" said Washington.\n\nCatch Washington live as he performs his new album on November 17 at the Nave, November 19 at Studio C, and November 26 at Cafecito Bonito for Lights Down Low.

Read on to discover 26 Thai food favorites that go beyond Thailand's famous noodle dish.\n\n© Daryl Hirsch/2foodtrippers Thai food is so much more than Pad Thai. Read on to discover 26 Thai food favorites that go beyond Thailand's famous noodle dish.\n\nThailand stole a piece of our hearts with its warm people, spiritual temples and stunning beaches. However, our favorite part about traveling to Thailand is eating Thai food at the source.\n\nFood in Thailand is everywhere and it's almost always good. This is a country with a seemingly never-ending supply of food available at all hours of the day and night. Sure, you can eat Thai food all over the world, but there's nothing like slurping down a bowl of Khao Soi in the Land of Smiles.\n\n© Daryl Hirsch/2foodtrippers The Thai people are some of the friendliest people we've met around the world. This friendly Thai grandma served us Banana Roti at Grandma's Pancakes in Pai.\n\nWe've traveled to more than 40 countries and Thailand stands out for both the quality and quantity of its food. Options run the gamut from warm and comforting to hot and spicy, and that's not contemplating Thai desserts which can be fruity, fried and fun.\n\nDuring our multiple visits, we've eaten Thai food at restaurants, shopping malls, street markets and literally on the street. We've also sipped coffee out of plastic baggies and indulged in international cuisine normally found in Taiwan, Italy and the United States.\n\nWhat Is Thai Cuisine? © Daryl Hirsch/2foodtrippers Thai cuisine is more than just Pad Thai. We cooked and ate this selection of classic Thai dishes at a cooking class in Chiang Mai.\n\nAsk ten westerners to name their favorite Thai dish and Pad Thai will likely be the most common answer. It's inevitable. But Pad Thai is just one dish in a diverse cuisine that incorporates all types of proteins as well a bounty of vegetables, herbs, rice and noodles.\n\nWhile many Thai food dishes are more modern inventions and incorporate influences from Asian countries like China, India and European countries like France and Great Britain, others date back centuries, passed down from generation to generation, to the kingdoms of Siam and Lanna.\n\n© Daryl Hirsch/2foodtrippers While many Thai food dishes are more modern inventions and incorporate influences from Asian countries like China, India and European countries like France and Great Britain, others date back centuries, passed down from generation to generation, to the kingdoms of Siam and Lanna.\n\nThai food has a reputation for being spicy. Although peppers are a popular Thai food ingredient, not all Thai food is as spicy as many travelers expect. Instead, Thai cooks combine bitter, salty, sweet and piquant flavors in their dishes.\n\nIt's important to remember Thailand's tropical locale. This is a cuisine where chilies meet coconut milk and where tropical kaffir/makrut limes meet palm sugar. It's a cuisine of rice. It's a cuisine of noodles. It's a country filled with great seafood, but it's also a country filled with great pork, beef, chicken and vegetarian food.\n\nOur History with Thai Food © Daryl Hirsch/2foodtrippers We're rarely hungry or thirsty in Thailand. We pretty much love all the food and drinks in the Southeast Asian country.\n\nOur history with Thai food dates back to 2002 when Mindi first visited Thailand as part of a 3-month solo backpacking trip in Southeast Asia. She kept returning to Thailand during that trip with stays in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Koh Lanta and Kho Phi Phi.\n\nMemories of eating street food on Khao San Road and getting her PADI open water diving certification in Khao Lak became legendary in her mind. She eventually returned with Daryl for an immersive month in 2016.\n\n© Daryl Hirsch/2foodtrippers If you see Sai Ua, i.e. Northern Thai Sausage, at a night market, eat it. We saw and ate these juicy pork balls in Chiang Mai.\n\nWe spent much of that month eating and working in Chiang Mai, a mecca for digital nomads like us. When we got tired of eating Thai food, we ate international foods like hamburgers, pizza and soup dumplings. But that was rare because we rarely tired of local food available at the city's many night markets.\n\nTrue Confession: We never used our kitchen once during an entire month in Chiang Mai. Eating out in Thailand was too cheap and too tasty to skip even once. However, we stocked up on Thai snack foods at local supermarkets and convenience stores.\n\nOur most recent visit to Thailand in 2018 took us back to Chiang Mai and ended with a week in Bangkok. Not letting any dust settle under our feet or in our mouths, we toured temples, ate copious amounts of street food and took a cooking class.\n\n© Daryl Hirsch/2foodtrippers We always find new things to eat in Thailand. We found these fish at the Wararot Market in Chiang Mai.\n\nThis trip introduced allowed us to revisit some of our favorite Chiang Mai spots while we discovered some (new-to-us) Thai food favorites at a floating market and hawker stalls throughout Bangkok. Instead of fulfilling our cravings, this trip further ignited our Thai food passion.\n\nWe can't wait to return to Thailand and eat more of... everything. Until then, we're scratching our Thai food itch by cooking red, green and panang curries at home in Lisbon.\n\nThai Food Guide © Daryl Hirsch/2foodtrippers Khao Soi is one of our favorite Thai dishes. We ate these flavorful bowls at Khao Soi Khun Yai in Chiang Mai.\n\nEating every single Thai dish is impossible whether you spend days, weeks or months in Thailand. Thai cuisine is that vast. However, there are certain Thai foods that you won't want to miss during your visit.\n\nOur guide highlights the Thai dishes that we love to eat when we're in Thailand. We've separated these foods into the following categories for ease of use:\n\nTraditional Thai FoodThai DessertsThai DrinksUnique Thai Food Experience\n\nWe recommend that you start with our the food in our guide and then expand your horizons based on your own sense of culinary exploration. We have our Thai food favorites and you'll develop your picks for the best Thai food too.\n\nVisit 2foodtrippers to discover 26 Thai food favorites including real-life photos and pro tips..\n\nJoin our email list and receive our free guide to eating like a local when you travel.\n\nContinue Reading Show full articles without \"Continue Reading\" button for {0} hours.",

Better yet, companies with a history of increasing dividends tend to outperform the overall stock market, according to a recent study on Dividend Aristocrats. These are companies that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.\n\nWith that in mind, let's look at three Dividend Aristocrats that could produce higher returns with lower volatility than the overall S&P 500 index.\n\nAnyone who has ever needed a car part is likely familiar with Genuine Parts Company (GPC 0.71%), owner of the NAPA Auto Parts brand. The auto parts chain also sells industrial replacement parts, and its stock has been one of the rare winners in 2022, with gains of roughly 30% year to date.\n\nThe stock, priced at around $179 per share, is soaring in 2022.

          "title": "$3M car-theft ring broken up, as N.J. continues to see big surge in stolen vehicles",
          "body": "State Police say they broke up a high-end car theft ring this week with the arrests of five suspects who allegedly stole more than 30 vehicles -- including Land Rovers and BMWs -- worth more than $3 million.\n\nThe charges followed a seven-month investigation that centered in Monmouth County, but involved a wide area spanning 10 counties and New York State.\n\nAccording to investigators, the stolen vehicles would be given fraudulent vehicle identification numbers to be re-titled and then resold online. In some cases, victims were allegedly confronted in their homes by members of the ring in an attempt to steal their late-model vehicles, officials said.\n\nThe arrests come as New Jersey has been confronting a surging car theft problem. There were 14,320 vehicles stolen in the state last year, with thefts up 22% over 2020. Officials expect those numbers to climb even higher this year.\n\n\"We've seen a brazenness, recently. You can hang those keys up on that post in your mudroom, that's a pretty easy spot to get to,\" superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, Col. Patrick Callahan, said last week, as Gov. Phil Murphy on Monday got behind proposed new legislation to address the car theft problem.\n\nThe measures backed by the governor would establish a \"persistent auto theft offender\" statute in New Jersey, that would give state and local prosecutors the option to seek more serious criminal consequences for those who have been repeatedly found guilty of stealing cars. The legislation would also make possession and distribution of certain auto theft tools a crime in the state. A third proposed bill would impose criminal penalties for the failure to comply with certain guidelines in the sale and purchase of catalytic converters in the state.\n\n\"We must do more to reduce the likelihood of car thefts and hold those who do commit these crimes accountable,\" said the governor, noting that too often, stolen cars are being used in shootings and other crimes of violence.\n\n\"We think we've started to bend the curve on the auto theft epidemic,\" he said during a news conference at the State Police headquarters in West Trenton.\n\nMurphy noted that car thefts in September of this year were actually down 14% compared to the prior year and thefts were down 12% in October from the previous year.\n\n\"Progress is in the right direction, but I think we're also here today to acknowledge that we need to do more,\" said the governor.\n\nEarlier this week, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-5th Dist., called upon the Department of Homeland Security to do more to stop stolen cars from being illegally exported through the nation's ports. During a Homeland Security Committee hearing in Washington, he told U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas that his department needed to take action.\n\n\"Clearly this is a serious issue,\" he said, noting what has become a nationwide rise in car theft, calling the problem not just a local crime issue, but international in scope with the emergence of multi-state and global crime rings.\n\nGottheimer has called for the creation of a National Auto Theft Task Force to coordinate federal, state, and local law enforcement efforts focused on combating interstate and international carjacking and auto theft. He also wants to see a boost in security at Port Newark and other ports to find and intercept more stolen cars before they are loaded into containers and shipped overseas.\n\n\"It feels like every other day we read about yet another carjacking or stolen car literally taken out of someone's driveway as they slept or, brazenly, in broad daylight,\" he said. \"Within minutes, these cars are chopped up for parts or they're brought here where they are immediately put onto ships.\"\n\nIn the arrests announced in Monmouth County this week, State Police said detectives began investigating multiple high-end motor vehicle thefts in Millstone Township and Upper Freehold Township earlier this year, which led to the arrest in July of Geovanni Hernandez, 24, of Newark, who they linked to the thefts of a BMW M8 and three Range Rovers.\n\nFour others were subsequently arrested and charged with conspiracy and theft this week. They included: Carlos Sanchez, 23, who State Police called the leader of the theft ring, along with James Lanier, 24, Solomon Mickens, 23, and Sadiq Griggs, 23, all of Newark. A sixth individual, Destiny Montalvo, 21, also of Newark, was arrested at her home and charged conspiring to dispose of evidence.\n\nAll were being held in the Monmouth County Correctional Institution pending a bail detention hearing.",

On top of the 15-yard penalty, it helped set up the Saints for their only touchdown of the game.\n\nJust because the hit was flagged, doesn't necessarily mean a fine is forthcoming. Often times, after reva play, the league will not fine a player if they feel it isn't warranted. In this case, the NFL clearly felt Kazee's hit was unnecessary and worthy of a fine.\n\nThe appeal process has begun for Kazee, who has already lost a lot of money this season while serving a suspension for violating the league's substance abuse policy. The suspension was served while he was on Injured Reserve (IR) and resulted in him not getting paid during that time.\n\nKazee made his return to the Steelers lineup on Week 10, and made an impact while notching his first interception of the season, and his first with the Steelers.\n\nBe sure to stay tuned to BTSC for the latest news and updates on the Steelers as they prepare for the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 11 of the 2022 regular season.",

Bindu has said.\n\nShe was addressing Edam, a get-together of the queer commmunity, organised at the Kerala Sahitya Akademi hall here on Saturday in connection with the 20th anniversary of Sahayathrika, an organisation that has been working with the community.\n\n\"Continuous awareness programmes are needed in society to prepare it to accept the queer community to the mainstream. The LDF government is committed to their welfare. Stay homes, health support and education scholarships are some of the welfare measures initiated for the welfare of the community,\" the Minster said. The government will provide financial support for sex reassignment surgeries, she added.\n\nDelivering the keynote address, A.K. Jayasree, Head of the Community Medicine department, Pariyaram Medical College, urged the government to form guidelines for reimbursement of expenses for sex reassignment surgeries.\n\nIn the absence of such guidelines, it is difficult to receive reimbursement of bills from private hospitals, she said, while calling for ban on conversion therapy, an attempt to change a person's sexual orientation to align with heterosexual and cisgender norms.\n\nDr. Jayasree recalled the political interventions the Sahayathrika has made for creating a space for the queer community in society.\n\n\"There was a time when society considered the very existence of queer persons a crime. Now, we have a transgender policy in the State and welfare measures declared by the government. Sahayathrika and its managing trustee Deepa Vasudev has played a crucial role in this transformation,\" she said.\n\nSocial activists who have led the activities of Sahayathrika were honoured at the function. Seminars were held on the topics 'Love, Sexualities and Celebrations' and 'Queer Community and Health Challenges.\"\n\nActor Shakeeela will inaugurate the programmes on Sunday. Seminars on the topic 'From Margins to Mainstream' and 'Ways to Social Justice' will be held.

          "title": "The Steelers are hoping changes result in a renewed focus and offensive growth",
          "body": "Prior to the start of training camp for the 2022 NFL season, I felt like I had a pretty good handle on the Steelers offensive game plan for the campaign. You know what they say about the best laid plans of mice and men.\n\nAdmittedly, precious little for the Steelers has went according to plan thus far this season. Expect the unexpected. That's some sage advice, even if it's often easier said than done.\n\nBen Roethlisberger retired after almost two decades as the franchise quarterback, meaning drastic changes were inevitable. The Steelers did their best to plan accordingly.\n\nThe Steelers went out and signed the biggest name on their free agency wish list in QB Mitchell Trubisky, an experienced veteran with mobility and potential. They also signed a couple of proven professionals to strengthen the offensive line in James Daniels and Mason Cole. They doubled down on their commitment to improve with a predominantly offensive draft class, headed by first round selection QB Kenny Pickett.\n\nThe Steelers plans for the offense seemed pretty transparent. Trubisky would be the starting quarterback, where his experience would provide leadership for the team's extremely young offensive unit, and his mobility would prove beneficial for the restructured offensive line. His abilities on the field appeared to be a ideal fit for Matt Canada's offense, while his off the field reputation was also a great match. A valuable example and mentor for Pickett.\n\nThe Steelers offensive concepts were designed to run through the contributors perceived to be their best weapons: Trubisky, Najee Harris, Diontae Johnson, and Chase Claypool. To say that the results have been disappointing would be an understatement.\n\nThe Steelers offense never found any semblance of a rhythm or identity under Trubisky. The revamped offensive line, despite the obvious uptick in talent, continues to struggle in putting a complete performance together. It takes time to develop the chemistry needed for improved execution, and there are no short cuts or substitutions for hard work. The inconsistency of the offensive line permeates throughout the entire offense.\n\nTrubisky failed to connection consistently with Johnson or Claypool. Johnson received the lion's share of the targets in the first half of the season, but was terribly inefficient with the high volume of opportunities. Claypool once again showed flashes of tantalizing potential, especially when working out of the slot, where his impressive run after the catch ability could be best utilized, but consistency alluded him.\n\nThere have been plenty of changes made to the Steelers offensive focus since the start of the season. Kenny Pickett has assumed the starting quarterback position. Najee Harris, after an injured and ineffective first half of the season, finds himself part of a potentially promising two back rotation with undrafted rookie Jaylen Warren. Chase Claypool is no more, after being traded to the Chicago Bears at the trade deadline. Rookie George Pickens has moved up a rung on the receiver ladder, as the Steelers look to better utilize his enormous skill set. Pat Freiermuth is destined for more targets in Claypool's absence.\n\nIt may have taken a little over half the season to get there, but I feel confident that the Steelers are finally headed in the right direction offensively, based solely on personnel usage, in spite of Matt Canada's presence. The Trubisky/Harris/Johnson/Claypool quartet has given way to the Pickett/Harris/Warren/Pickens/Freiermuth collective. This is a step in the right direction, consisting of a conglomerate of young players who are signed with the franchise for the foreseeable future.\n\nAny offensive improvement achieved during the remainder of this season is predicated on the continued growth of the aforementioned offensive line. The Steelers would be wise to utilize the rest of 2022 to evaluate and identify the greatest areas of need in rebuilding their offensive foundation.\n\nThe cream always rises to the top, and James Daniels has met or exceeded my expectations. Mason Cole has been a stabilizing force in the center of the line, both in execution and leadership. Chukwuma Okorafor is having his best season, and has formed an impressive connection with Daniels. Dan Moore Jr. is still a work in progress, but he just produced the best run blocking performance in his young career against the Saints. Kevin Dotson has struggled with his health and his consistency, causing many to question his fit within the Steelers current blocking schemes. Answers are needed prior to the offseason, but the Steelers could be a stud lineman away from an offensive revival.\n\nKenny Pickett finds himself in a favorable position with the rebuilding Steelers. The cupboard is hardly bare, as the Steelers have plenty of untapped potential on offense. The Steelers are a young and talented offensive group, who lack the type of chemistry that only comes with experience, plus a clear and proven leader. That has to be Pickett's main objective moving forward, to prove he is the right man for the job.\n\nThe Steelers recent personnel shuffling on offense appears to have potentially created a couple of golden opportunities for some fringe level depth players working hard to find their niche in the NFL. Steven Sims and Miles Boykin both stand to benefit from the Steelers reimagining.\n\nSims and Boykin are already entrenched as special teams standouts; Sims as the return specialist, and Boykin as potentially the best gunner in the NFL. Both gentlemen would love nothing more than the professional security afforded to entrusted offensive contributors. The opportunity could very well be there, if they can only grasp that brass ring.\n\nSims has the toughness, elusiveness, and short area quickness to excel out of the slot. Freiermuth will work out of the slot on occasion, but the remaining reps are there to be had. Sims needs to develop a rapport with Pickett as a trusted outlet. He may never have a better professional opportunity than now.\n\nBoykin should immediately step into Claypool's big receiver role. He can make extended hands catches as he shields defenders with his large frame. That is a favorable attribute to possess on an offense struggling mightily in the red zone. Somebody send Canada a memo.",

          "title": "Elizabeth Holmes Gets More Than 11 Years for Theranos Scam",
          "body": "SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes was sentenced Friday to more than 11 years in prison for duping investors in the failed startup that promised to revolutionize blood testing but instead made her a symbol of Silicon Valley ambition that veered into deceit.\n\nThe sentence imposed by U.S. District Judge Edward Davila was shorter than the 15-year penalty requested by federal prosecutors but far tougher than the leniency her legal team sought for the mother of a year-old son with another child on the way.\n\nHolmes, 38, faced a maximum of 20 years in prison. Her legal team requested no more than 18 months, preferably served in home confinement.\n\n\"This is a very heavy sentence,\" said Rachel Fiset, a defense lawyer who has also been involved in health care cases.\n\nHolmes, who was CEO throughout the company's turbulent 15-year history, was convicted in January in the scheme, which revolved around the company's claims to have developed a medical device that could detect a multitude of diseases and conditions from a few drops of blood. But the technology never worked, and the claims were false.\n\nTheranos was dashed \"by misrepresentations, hubris and just plain lies,\" the judge said.\n\n\"This case is so troubling on so many levels,\" Davila said. \"What was it that caused Ms. Holmes to make the decisions she did? Was there a loss of a moral compass?\"\n\nHolmes' meteoric rise once landed her on the covers of business magazines that hailed her as the next Steve Jobs. And her deception was persuasive enough to draw in a list of sophisticated investors, including software magnate Larry Ellison, media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the Walton family behind Walmart.\n\nShe sobbed as she told the judge she accepted responsibility for her actions.\n\n\"I regret my failings with every cell of my body,\" Holmes said. She promised Davila she would devote the remainder of her life to trying to help others.\n\nHolmes' attorney, Kevin Downey, indicated she would appeal the sentence. Holmes and her family left the courthouse by a side entrance and managed to evade reporters and photographers.\n\nBefore handing down the sentence, Davila reflected on Silicon Valley's transition from an agricultural hub populated by farmers and ranchers to a \"crucible of innovation\" brimming with bright-eyed entrepreneurs dreaming of changing the world.\n\nRecalling the humble beginnings of technology pioneer Hewlett-Packard in a small garage in Palo Alto -- the same city where Theranos was based -- he spoke wistfully of \"honest, hard work.\"\n\n\"That, I would hope, will be the legacy and continuation of this valley,\" the judge said.\n\nAmanda Kramer, a former federal prosecutor who is now a defense attorney, described the sentence as \"the equivalent of neon, flashing billboard\" offering \"a reminder the long-term consequences of fraud far outweigh any short-term gains.\"\n\nThe sentencing in the same San Jose courtroom where Holmes was convicted on four counts of investor fraud and conspiracy marked another climactic moment in a saga that has been dissected in an HBO documentary and an award-winning Hulu series.\n\nHer lawyers argued that Holmes was a well-meaning entrepreneur who is now a devoted mother. Their viewpoints were supported by more than 130 letters submitted by family, friends and former colleagues praising Holmes.\n\nDavila suggested that the letters might have struck a different tone had the writers seen and heard all the evidence shown to the jury.\n\nProsecutors also wanted Holmes to pay $804 million in restitution -- an amount that covers most of the nearly $1 billion that she raised from investors. But the judge left that question for a future hearing that has not been scheduled.\n\nWhile wooing investors, Holmes leveraged a high-powered Theranos board that included former Defense Secretary James Mattis, who testified against her during her trial, and two former secretaries of state, Henry Kissinger and the late George Shultz, whose son, Alexander submitted a statement blasting Holmes for concocting a scheme that played Shultz \"for the fool.\"\n\nAlexander Shultz made a brief appearance Friday to lambaste her for terrorizing his son, Tyler, a former Theranos employee turned whistleblower who helped The Wall Street Journal expose the flaws in the company's blood-testing technology.\n\nBefore the first in a series of Journal articles appeared in October 2015, Alexander Shultz said Holmes hired private investigators to follow Tyler. The surveillance made Tyler so fearful that Alexander said his son began sleeping in his bed with a knife.\n\nThe judge gave Holmes more than five months of freedom before she must report to prison on April 27 -- a window of time that should enable her to give birth to her second child before she is incarcerated. She gave birth to a son shortly before her trial started last year.\n\nIf Holmes' pregnancy had a role in determining her sentence, the decision could prove controversial. A 2019 study found that more than 1,000 pregnant women entered federal or state prisons over a 12-month study period; 753 of them gave birth in custody.\n\nAccording to a 2016 survey by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, more than half of women entering federal prison -- 58% -- reported being mothers of minor children.\n\nKramer said it seemed clear that Davila did not allow the pregnancy to sway his judgement. His sentence \"was a lesson about justice being blind, whether you are woman, a mother, a powerful figure, you are still going to be treated equally under the law.\"\n\nFederal prosecutor Robert Leach described the Theranos scam as one of the most egregious white-collar crimes ever committed in Silicon Valley. In a scathing 46-page memo, Leach urged the judge to send a message to curb the hubris and hyperbole unleashed by the tech boom of the last 30 years.\n\nEven though Holmes was acquitted on four counts of fraud and conspiracy tied to patients who took Theranos blood tests, Leach also asked the judge to factor in the health threats posed by Holmes' conduct.\n\nEvidence submitted during her trial showed the tests produced wildly unreliable results that could have steered patients toward the wrong treatments.\n\nHolmes lawyers painted her as a selfless visionary who spent 14 years trying to revolutionize health care. They asserted that Holmes never stopped trying to perfect the technology until Theranos collapsed in 2018.\n\nThey also pointed out that Holmes never sold any of her Theranos shares -- a stake valued at $4.5 billion in 2014. \"Where did all the money go? To building technology,\" Downey said.\n\nIn court documents, Downey also asked Davila to consider the alleged sexual and emotional abuse Holmes suffered while she was involved romantically with Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, who became a Theranos investor, top executive and eventually an accomplice in her crimes.\n\nBalwani, 57, is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 7 after being convicted in a July trial on 12 counts of fraud and conspiracy.",

          "title": "How BJP is eyeing a 7th straight win in Gujarat, riding on Hindutva again - CurrentNews",
          "body": "Prashun Bhaumik | Ahmedabad | 19 November, 2022 | 08:30 PM\n\nThe BJP is eyeing a seventh straight win in Gujarat by banking on Hindutva tones and a heavy dose of developmental projects, and denying tickets to 38 MLAs to beat anti-incumbency.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been in power in Gujarat for 27 years, is eyeing a seventh straight win in the assembly elections in the state by banking on Hindutva tones, loudest since 2002, and heavy dose of developmental projects, worth ?2 lakh crore in past nine months, and denying tickets to 38 MLAs, a year after it replaced almost the entire cabinet, to beat anti-incumbency.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi set the tone for the BJP's campaign in his home state by carrying out a grand roadshow in Ahmedabad on March 11, a day after his party stormed back to power in the country's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh and retained Uttarakhand, Manipur and Goa.\n\nApart from irrigation, healthcare and educational projects, the Prime Minister also inaugurated two key national events including the National Games and the Defence Expo 2022, both held in Gujarat this time.\n\nThe projects inaugurated by PM Modi also included the Smriti Van Memorial in Kutch in memory of the 13,000 people who died in an earthquake on January 26, 2001, and an aircraft manufacturing facility in Vadodara to be set up jointly by Airbus and Tata group.\n\nThe BJP's best performance was in 2002 under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was the chief minister of the state at that time. The party bagged 127 seats. The highest number of seats ever was 149 by the Congress in 1985 under the leadership of Madhavsinh Solanki.\n\nIn his first election rally after the Gujarat elections were declared, Modi on November 4 said at Kaprada: \"This time I wish to break all my previous records. The record for (chief minister) Bhupendra (Patel) should be bigger than mine and I want to work to achieve this.\" At this rally, the Prime Minister released the party's election slogan 'Aa Gujarat mein banavyu che' (We have made this Gujarat).\n\nStrategic shift\n\nThis is quite a shift from the 2012 elections when Modi was the chief minister and the party had launched a campaign around the theme 'Hun Modi No Manas Chu' (I am Modi's man). In 2017, the party's campaign slogan 'Hun chu Vikas, hun chu Gujarat' (I am development, I am Gujarat) was strongly countered by the Congress' 'Vikas Gando Thayo Che' (development gone beserk) campaign that tried to puncture the BJP's claims of development in Gujarat.\n\nCompared to the 2012 campaign, the BJP this time has gone for an inclusive campaign where people are to take pride in the development work done in Gujarat in the last two decades. The party is in power in Gujarat since 1995.\n\nWhile the campaign hovers around PM Modi, the party has strategically worked on the candidates. The party denied tickets to senior leaders such as former chief minister Vijay Rupani and former deputy chief minister Nitin Patel and opted for new faces such as former Patidar quota leader Hardik Patel, cricketer Ravindra Jadeja's wife Rivaba Jadeja and OBC leader Alpesh Thakor, among others.\n\nThe BJP has also decided to field only tested Congress turncoats. After 2017, 16 sitting Congress MLAs had defected to the BJP and only 11 of them got BJP tickets. Another six former Congress defectors also got tickets.\n\nIn 2017, the turncoats were directly given tickets for assembly elections. This time the party has tested the results of many turncoats in the by-polls, said a BJP leader. \"Take for instance the Jasdan seat, where the BJP has never won except once in 2009 when Kunvarji Bavaliya, with the Congress then, vacated it following his election for Rajkot Lok Sabha seat. Bavliya contested on a Congress ticket in 2017 and won with a margin of about 10,000 votes. After he joined the BJP and contested the by-election in 2018, he won by a higher margin of over 20,000 votes,\" he added. He said that the BJP was expecting victory by a comfortable margin for some tough seats in Saurashtra and Tribal areas that have been a traditional stronghold of the Congress, by fielding candidates who have won multiple times.\n\nFor the BJP, the focus is on Saurasthra and Kutch, where the party in 2017 bagged only 23 of 54 seats and the Congress won 30 primarily due to agitation by Patidars demanding reservation in job. With the issue now settled with 10% reservation for economically backward classes, the party believes Patels, considered as the BJP's traditional voters, would return to its fold, helping the party to win these regions.\n\nAs a result, the party has given tickets generously to Patidars such as Ramesh Tilara (Rajkot South), considered close to Patidar strongman Naresh Patel, chairman of the Khodaldham Trust, and Babujamana Patel (Unjha), chairman of the Umiya Mataji Sansthan. The Khodaldham Trust has a huge following of Leuva Patidars while the Umiya Mataji Sansthan is popular among Kadva Patidars.\n\nNew challenger\n\nIf it was the Congress that was raising issues like unemployment, reservation rights for the Patidar community, farmers issues and demonetization in the 2017 elections, this time around the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has been raising issues like corruption, education, healthcare and unemployment.\n\nThe AAP has gained popularity in the BJP bastion announcing 'guarantees' like free electricity, free education, monthly stipend to unemployed youth and for women above the age of 18 years if they are voted to power in the assembly elections. In local body polls in 2021, the BJP won 6,236 out of 8,470 seats, the rival Congress won 1,805 seats and the AAP made its debut winning 42 seats.\n\nThe BJP believes that the AAP will not be able to challenge it as rarely success in local body polls translate into win in bigger polls. Union home minister Amit Shah, who is also from Gujarat, on Wednesday said that in the state's history the contest had always been bipolar and the third party had vanished after polls. \"I believe that contest is between the Congress and the BJP and the AAP is nowhere,\" he said.\n\n\"The AAP would cut the votes of the Congress that will ultimately increase the BJP's seat tally. The OBC votes, a large chunk of which went to the Congress last time, will be split between the AAP and the Congress,\" said another BJP leader, who did not wish to be named. He added that the OBCs constitute about 42% of the total vote share.\n\nHindutva going strong\n\nOn October 8, posters and banners of AAP national chief Arvind Kejriwal donning a Muslim skull cap came up across the cities of Gujarat a day after a video was shared on social media of AAP's Delhi minister Rajendra Pal Gautam attending an event in Delhi where some Hindus vowed to convert to Buddhism. \"The Aam Aadmi Party's ideology is against Hindus. In the coming days, the AAP will be wiped out,\" said former Gujarat chief minister Rupani in a social media post then.\n\nIn the first week of October, more than 50 illegal structures at Beyt Dwarka island in Dev Bhoomi Dwarka district of Gujarat were demolished in an operation that went on for five days. Most of them were religious shrines belonging to the Muslim community as they were illegal. Similar operation was carried out along the coastal belt in places like Porbander and Gir Somnath regions. All of them are in Saurasthra.\n\nPM Modi on October 10 lauded the anti-encroachment drive. \"I used to say that Bhupendra Patel is a firm person and the people of Gujarat also got a glimpse of this recently. On the coastal belt of Gujarat, people who were enjoying by setting up illegal structures, watched in silence as it was all wiped off.\n\nCongratulations Bhupendrabhai. When a determined person is ruling, the message reaches down,\" he told at a rally in Jamnagar.\n\nA few days before the PM's Jamnagar visit, a video clip went viral of policemen publicly flogging a few men from the Muslim community who allegedly hurled stones to disrupt a Navratri event at Kheda on October 3. As per an FIR filed on October 3 at Matar police station by one Indravadan Patel, 43 people were accused of disrupting garba procession at Undhela village.\n\nMujahid Nafees, convener of the Minority Co-ordination Committee, Gujarat, on October 6 issued a legal notice to the state government, Gujarat home department, director general of police (DGP) Gujarat and Kheda superintendent of police (SP), for initiating suitable action against the erring police officials responsible for flogging in Undhela Village of Matar Taluka of Kheda district.\n\n\"Those who were flogged are all belonging to the minority Muslim community. Despite the atrocity at the behest of the police personnel having been widely reported, no action has been taken/initiated till date and is in complete violation of all rights of those flogged by those who are responsible for maintaining law and order,\" according to the legal notice by Nafees in the first week of October.\n\nOn February 21, a caricature tweeted by the Gujarat BJP hailing the special court's February 20 verdict sentencing 38 convicts to death in the 2008 Ahmedabad serial blasts case was removed after it caused a controversy. The cartoon depicted men wearing skull caps hanging by the noose. With a drawing depicting the scene of a bomb blast in the background, it had a tricolour in it and \"Satyamev Jayate\" written on its top right corner.\n\n\"The way the tickets are distributed and the narrative is being created for the ruling BJP in Gujarat, it seems they are back to 2002 when elections were held after the post Godhra riots. It was not so much in 2007 or 2012. The way Bilkis Banu convicts were released or ticket has been given to a Naroda Patiya convict's daughter, it shows that the BJP is desperate this time,\" said Ghanshyam Shah, an Ahmedabad based political expert.\n\nPayal Kukarni, the daughter of Manoj Kukrani, who was convicted in the Naroda Patiya massacre of 97 persons in 2002, has been given a ticket by the BJP from Naroda. Manoj Kukarni was given a life imprisonment sentence and is currently out on bail.\n\nThe party has also re-nominated C K Raulji from Godhra who gave approval on the controversial release of convicted rapists of Bilkis Bano. He was not only a member of the committee to decide the issue but had later justified their release on August 15 as they are \"Brahmins and cultured\".\n\nOn August 15, eleven men in Gujarat convicted for the 2002 gang rape of Bilkis Bano and the murder of seven of her family members walked free from jail after the state government allowed their release under a remission policy.\n\nCourtesy Hindustan Times",

          "body": "Residents in western New York can expect even more snow Saturday after a major winter storm walloped the region Friday, dropping more than 5 feet in some areas and shutting down schools and businesses.\n\nAt least two people died from cardiac arrest while shoveling snow.\n\nNational Weather Service Buffalo Office meteorologist Liz Jurkowski said some places could get hit with another foot or two into Saturday.\n\n\"Things should start to lighten up a bit,\" Jurkowski told NPR. \"You should be able to get outside and start clearing out some of that snow, and you'll wake up to a couple more inches Sunday morning.\"\n\nThe NWS said snow could be heavy at times in Buffalo on Saturday through late afternoon, with wind gusts up to 36 mph. The agency also said a lake-effect snow warning will remain in effect until 1 p.m. ET on Sunday in Northern Erie and Genesee counties, saying that travel could be \"very difficult to impossible.\"\n\nBuffalo set a record for daily snowfall on Saturday, accumulating 16.1 inches by about 9:30 a.m.\n\nThe weather agency reported some towns in Erie County had received more than 5 feet of snow on Friday. Further north in the state, some parts of Jefferson County got nearly 50 inches on Friday.\n\nIn Hamburg, south of Buffalo, emergency crews struggled to reach people on Friday, WBFO's Emyle Watkins told NPR. Other towns in the area had not been hit nearly as badly, with some areas north of Buffalo getting just inches of snow.\n\nCrews were working around the clock to clear the the wet, heavy snow that was falling at a faster rate than normal.\n\nJohn Pilato, the highway superintendent for the town of Lancaster, said he's trying to keep his snow crews fed and rested while they camp out at the highway department.\n\n\"Bought as much food and grub that we could just to have on hand for these guys. We bought a bunch of K-cups so we could keep them a little bit caffeinated and fueled up,\" Pilato told Watkins. \"It's hard, it's very hard. They're not in their own bed, they're in a chair, or they're in a cot.\"\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Thursday declared a state of emergency that covered 11 counties in the western part of the state. That included a number of travel bans on local interstates and roads.\n\nSchools in Buffalo and around Erie County canceled classes Friday, while Amtrak shut down stations in the area.\n\nThe NFL also announced Thursday that a Buffalo Bills home game scheduled for this Sunday against the Cleveland Browns has been moved to Detroit in a decision that \"has everything to do about safety,\" Bills Executive Vice President Ron Raccuia said to ESPN.\n\nKyra Laurie, a college student who became stranded at her parent's house south of Buffalo in Orchard Park that got several feet of snow, told Watkins she's having a good time with her family, but said this storm caught her by surprise.\n\n\"Being from Buffalo, you just assume that you'll make it, that you can truck through any kind of snowstorm, but I feel like this one's been really aggressive,\" Laurie said.\n\nThe region is being pummeled by lake-effect snow, which occurs when cold air passes over a relatively warm body of water, picking up a lot of moisture and dropping it over land. Areas near lakes can experience snowfall rates up to 3 inches an hour or more.\n\nColin Beier, an associate professor at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, told NPR the the difference between lake and air temperatures in the area is highest until spring.\n\n\"It doesn't surprise me that with that big shift to cold air, you still got a warm lake, if it's pointed right at a big city like Buffalo or anywhere it's pointed you're going to get very a significant amount of snow right now,\" Beier said.",
